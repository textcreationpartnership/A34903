            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO the Right VVorſhipful the <hi>MAJOR,</hi> the <hi>ALDERMEN,</hi> and <hi>B<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RGESSES,</hi> of the City of <hi>LONDON DERRY,</hi> and of the Presbyterian perſwaſion.</head>
            <p>THeſe Animadverſions on the Biſhop's Book, are Dedicated to your Service, the Author and his Labours being yours by Right; Tho' this piece of Service be extorted, having no apprehenſion of appearing in this manner, had it not been the vindication of Truth, the undeceiving of ſtrangers, and your uneaſineſs to find our manner of Worſhip expoſed, vilified, and repreſented to the World as pure humane Invention, and therefore nothing but Will-worſhip; and yet worſe, being made as black as Heathens, denying due Adoration to God, and caſting his Word out of our Aſſemblies: a rare notion that all the polite Maſters of moſt exuberant Invention, had never the brow to brand our perſwaſion with, before this Author appeared, who will be ſingular.</p>
            <p>And ſince we are now ſet out to the world as worſe than the moſt degenerated and barbarous people that ever called themſelves Chriſtians, and thereby a Clothing of wild Beaſts forced on us, as on many primitive Chriſtians to inrage their Devourers; its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed none can offend, if by a juſt Vindication we ſtrip our ſelves of this covering, that the World may ſee we are no Savages.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:97381:3"/>
            <p>However this may appear <hi>impar congreſſus,</hi> as not ſtanding on even ground with the Biſhop; yet Truth being on our ſide, and he the firſt Aggreſſor, there's no fear but the God of Truth will throughly plead his own Cauſe: Therefore leſt by the Author's bare naming of many Scriptures, whether pertinent to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe or not, any ſhould be ſeduced, or vainly think his Book can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be anſwered by any of us, who are arraigned and provocked, or that we are haters of Light, and unwilling our deeds ſhould be made manifeſt, whether wrought in God or not, or that we are aſhamed of our manner of Worſhip, or that we have not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence to convince gainſayers, and ſo ſuffer Truth to be betrayed by unreaſonable ſilence, and leſt that ſtrangers, or our ſucceeding Poſterity ſhould be impreſſed with Calumnies for Truths; tho<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>I</hi> be the very weakeſt of my Brethren, yet being in ſome ſpecial manner concerned in this place, and a Book ſent me by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, am willing to try the ſtrength of his Arguments, truſting that God will appear to make the iſſue and reſult of this Debate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducive to the further ſtrengthning and eſtabliſhment of many fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of God, who deſire to live and die in the Old Good Paths, and therein to find reſt to their Souls.</p>
            <p>Yet I do freely declare to you my Worthy and Beloved Friends, that the conſtraint of putting ſuch a Book into your hands, on ſo mean a ſubject, miniſtreth to me ſome melancholy reflections; for if ever any of my poor Labours had been worth your notice, after <hi>I</hi> had finiſhed my courſe, it would been more comfortable to me, if the ſubject had engaged a Diſcourſe, of things more profitable &amp; ſpiritual than meer <hi>Jejune forms:</hi> knowing the people of <hi>London<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> derry,</hi> being as a Firebrand pluckt out of the fire, ſtand in need of more ſuitable entertainment, how to make due returns of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude for ſo ſignal deliverance, than to be treated with a Diſpute of Forms, ſo remote from the power of Godlineſs, and the preſent due ſenſe of Works of Wonder, done for this people, which we are apt ſinfully to forget, tho peremptorly required to take heed, <hi>leſt we forget the things which our eyes have ſeen, lest they depart from our heart, all the days of our life, but to teach them to our ſons, and ſons ſons.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:97381:3"/>
            <p>God hath much to require of <hi>Derry,</hi> more than other places in point of Gratitude; <hi>Auguſt. epiſt. ad Marcell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> ſpeaking of gratitude, piouſly ſaith, <hi>what better thing can we bear in our mind? expreſs with our lips? record with our Pen? hear more joyfully? conſider with greater plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure? or what better fruit can we bear than gratitude?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It cannot therefore be unſeaſonable, to put you in mind of theſe things, tho' ye know them; or to improve this occaſion for the help of others hereafter, to retain a due impreſſion and regard to the great Works of God, there being no people in theſe Kingdoms, whoever had more ſpecial and immediat appearing of Soveraign Dominion, Wiſdom, and Mercy, than <hi>this City,</hi> if it be conſidered</p>
            <p>That after vaſt numbers of people were frighted into it as a place of refuge, not knowing of one another, nor what they ſhould do when within theſe Walls, having no Ruler but God alone, as of different perſwaſions, ſo of different ſentiments, many conſulting a Surrender on Terms as moſt rational, ſome few reſolved againſt it (of which I was an Eye Witneſs) many ſecret enemies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, correſponding with thoſe without; a potent Army under good Conduct, cloſs about the City; Streets, Lanes and Walls, often as in Fire, with multitude of Bombs, and many killed in Houſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions failing, and Soldiers almoſt ſtarved, yet ſallying out, wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed valiant in Fight; when their Enemies ſtrong and full, found not their hands, but fainted in the day of Battel; when not only mens bodies were faint and ſick with Famine, but hope of relief being deferred, made their hearts ſick alſo; yet when weakeſt, were ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated to that heroick reſolve, to put a period to their own miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and perpetuat their loyalty by fighting to death, when they could ſtay no longer within theſe Walls, rather than yield: I know of one fainting man, who ſaid, <hi>within theſe three days we muſt either ſurrender or be dead men by famine; but was ſmartly taken up by others, replying, he was not worthy to live who ſpoke it, and while there was Dog or Cat in</hi> Derry, <hi>yet remaining, there ſhould be no ſurrender; and further told him, you ſhall eat that Hat on your Head ere we yield.</hi> At this time the City was all over Deaths and Corps, and rare to ſee a Mourner for the neareſt Relation, when buried, many faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:97381:4"/> on the Streets for want of the Fruits of the Earth; the City then appearing for no other uſe but to be a common Sepulchre to them all: nothing remain'd, but hope againſt hope, only by the good Providence of God, there were many Godly praying perſons in the place, both Citizens and Strangers, who were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with calling on God, long before they came into this diſtreſs, theſe prayed without ceaſing; and the hearer of Prayer, did graciouſly ſo far condeſcend unto ſome of them, that during the whole Siege, and in greateſt extremities, were comforted by the hope of deliverance in Gods due time, and ſome of them being Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, of what perſwaſion, I ſhall not ſo much as name, that all may joyn together in due praiſes, <hi>not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy Name give glory, for thy mercy and for thy truths ſake:</hi> for when humane ſtrength was gone, then did the God of mercy appear, and his own Arm brought Salvation, ſending food to the fainting remnant, thorow the Fire of their Enemies on every ſide, they gnaſhing their Teeth and melting away: and thus by Divine Power and Mercy, the place of Deaths, was made a beginning of Reviving, and Life to the whole Nation.</p>
            <p>Who, at this day out of their graves have it to ſay, they came out of their graves as the remnant of <hi>Derry;</hi> when this people were as if their bones had been ſcattered at the graves mouth; who could have anſwered that queſtion but God? can <hi>theſe dry bones live?</hi> who but he alone could put fleſh, ſinews and skin upon them, and breath Life into the dead, making them to ſtand up as an Army ſo terrible, that their beſiegers were frighted from their Walls, haſtning far away, when nothing purſued them but the Terrour of God?</p>
            <p>Shall he remember us in our low eſtate, and we forget him? ſhall he to whom it's a humbling of himſelf to behold the things that are in Heaven and earth, look down and ſend from above, drawing us out of theſe depths, and we not ſo much as look up to the hand doing it?</p>
            <p>Hath God appointed Salvation for Walls and Bulwarks, when there was no ſtrength to defend our walls of Stone and Clay? ſhall
<pb facs="tcp:97381:4"/> it be ſaid of this City thou haſt forgotten the God of thy Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and haſt not been mindful of the Rock of thy ſtrength?</p>
            <p>Hath God fruſtrated and rejected the confident expectations of our enemies? hath he given them wine of aſtoniſhment to drink, and taken the cup of trembling out of our hand? hath he amuzed and confounded them with his works of wonder for <hi>Derry?</hi> inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that ſome of the beſiegers being ſurprized that the gates were not opened unto them, and afterward finding that the flower of their Army fell before theſe walls: ſaid, <hi>God doth fight for</hi> Derry, but blaſphemouſly added, <hi>God was not juſt in ſo doing,</hi> this I can inſtruct by ſome of deſerved reputation, to whom it was ſpoken, and yet alive.</p>
            <p>Oh! that men would Praiſe the Lord for his Goodneſs, and for his Wonderfull Works; and not be as theſe who Sung his Praiſe, but ſoon forgot his Works: For Preventing of this For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geting, <hi>Chryſoſt. on Math<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Homil.</hi> 25.

            <p>It is great Mercy to be helped of God to underſtand the Depth of our Mercies, for ſome are Preſerved who were not ready to Die, &amp; if by the Furnace we have been in, our Droſs be not Purged away, and we become not a Refined People meet for the Maſter's Uſe, we have reaſon yet to fear a Furnace more hot, where God in his Juſtice may Melt and leave us. Let us therefore fear him and his Goodneſs, let us Live to him, who made us Live in the Jaws of Death; let us take Pleaſure to ſpeak of his Mighty Acts, and teſtifie our Gratitude by an Holy, Juſt and Exemplary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, provocking one another unto Love and good Works, walking by the ſame Rule, minding the ſame Thing, as men of one heart and one way.</p>

               <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
               <p>THE Author beginneth his work with a Scripture ſo awful, and appoſite, that it would have been a ſingular help to his memory, if the ſame had been written on top of every Page, before his Book had been filled up, the words are;</p>
               <p>Mark 7. 7. <hi>In vain do they worſhip me, Teaching for Doctrines the Commandments of men, this obligeth every man who hath a concern for his Soul, to examine the Worſhip he offers to God, whether it be ſuch as God hath inſtituted,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> All this is good and neceſſary, wanting nothing but due obſervation, for all of us ſhould teſtifie the veneration we owe to ſo important warning from the Mouth of <hi>Christ.</hi> Let us come then to a fair Tryal, who are moſt guilty of teaching for Doctrines the Commandments of men, and what he offereth according to reaſon ſhall be admitted, whether it breath a Spirit of meekneſs or not, which is rather deſirable than diſcernable in his Book.</p>
               <p>The Author cometh more cloſs to his Work, <hi>Page</hi> 3, and there placeth two ſound Poſitions, firſt in theſe words,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That it belongeth only to God to give Rules how he will be worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped. The</hi> 2d, <hi>That the Holy Scriptures contain the Revelations of God's will concerning his Worſhip.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I can deſire no more of the Author, but that the Superſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture be fitted to theſe Foundations, they are ſo ſure, that God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling I ſhall ſtand by them, to the end of this Diſcourſe: But if he who aſſerteth them be found going off, or building Hay or Stuble upon them, let him not take it ill if I help his memory as occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on offereth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3ly.</hi> His Inference from theſe two, <hi>viz. That from theſe two we may reaſonably infer, that it concerns us to keep as cloſe as we can,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:97381:6"/> to thoſe directions which God hath afforded us in his word, without adding to, omiting, or altering any thing he hath there laid down, for ſince God hath vouchafed us a certain direction for his worſhip in the holy Scriptures; It's to be ſuppoſed, that all wayes of worſhip are diſpleaſing to him, that are not either expreſly contained, or warranted by Examples of holy men mentioned therein.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> This alſo is found; provided alwayes that what is ſaid of the examples of <hi>holy-men</hi> be duely cautioned, for all the examples of holy-men mentioned in Scripture are not obligatory.</p>
               <p>Some of them being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ad even in the matters of God; as <hi>Peter's</hi> diſſembling for fear of the <hi>Jews,</hi> here was a hurteful example of an holy man, for <hi>Barnabas</hi> was carried away with this diſſimulation. Some of them affected Preheminency, diſputing who ſhould be greateſt: theſe are no warrands for us to do the like; ſeeing we are to follow them, but as they were followers of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> again, ſome of their practices were by extraordinary gifts, wherein they are above our Imitation: Some of them were by ſpecial direction <hi>hic &amp; nunc,</hi> for avoiding offence, as <hi>Paul's</hi> circumciſing <hi>Timothy,</hi> ſuch was his purifying of himſelf in the Temple, according to the Ceremonial law: theſe practices were not patterns for other holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, tho' contemporary with themſelves, nor do the practices of any men oblidge others, without either ſome antecedent or conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitant evidence, that it's the revealed will of God, ſuch practices ſhould be followed; otherways men ſhould be Idols to us, making them Fathers of our Religion, in which reſpect we are to call no man Father.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Page 3d.</hi> The Author diſtinguiſheth worſhip into either inward or outward.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The ſubject in hand requireth more diſtinctions of worſhip; as into civil and Religious; for many worſhiped <hi>Chriſt</hi> on earth, with civil worſhip, only as a great Prophet and fame in the world, intending no Divine Adoration: next Ceremonial worſhip ſhould have alſo been diſtinguiſhed from Evangelical; for by Levitical
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97381:7"/> worſhip, Sacrifices, the obſervation of feaſts, divers waſhings were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, which by the coming of <hi>Chriſt</hi> are abrogated; theſe being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Ordinances, and ſome better things provided for us: our Saviour principally requiring ſuch worſhip, as is in Spirit and Truth, not excluding external Adoration as it's required.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Page</hi> 4. We have a Deſcription of inward and outward Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; <hi>The inward Worſhip of God, conſiſts in the inward Homage and Subjection of our minds to him; the outward conſisteth of ſuch acts and duties, as ſerve to expreſs this inward ſubjection of our Souls, or that promote, increaſe, or contribute towards it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I paſs the Deſcription of the inward, but the Deſcription of the outward Worſhip is unſound, and of dangerous conſequence, and had been eaſily helped, if the Author had ſaid it conſiſteth of ſuch Acts and Duties, as God hath appointed for his Worſhip; but according to his Aſſertion there is an open Gap, made for all the Humane Inventions that the fertile imagination of man can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe, providing he but think they will ſerve to promote, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to inward Homage; thus the <hi>Papists</hi> have brought in moſt of all their Idolatry, and Superſtitions; and others may do the like, if they but apprehend what they do, may promote inward Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. Here my Author goeth off his Foundation, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures contain the Revelations of God's Will, how He will be Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped; and if I were of the Author's Judgment, declared by this Deſcription, I would never have put Pen to Paper againſt the Inventions of Men in the Worſhip of God; for it's vain to open a wide Door for them, and then forbid men to come in.</p>
               <p>Page 4. <hi>We must remember that it's in theſe outward Acts, that we are more immediatly concerned as publick Worſhippers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I do not take the Authors meaning to be ſo bad as his words, in what is here aſſerted, ſuppoſing the ſenſe of his Words to be, that men <hi>diſputing of Worſhip,</hi> they are more immediatly concerned in outward Worſhip than inward; for certainly as <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting Worſhip</hi> we are moſt concerned in the inward Adoration of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:97381:7"/> the Soul; as Chriſt hath taught, that the Father ſeeketh ſuch to worſhip, <hi>as worſhip him in Spirit and Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The laſt thing in the Introduction is the Diſtribution of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip into its parts.</p>
               <p>Praiſes, Prayers, Hearing, Bodily Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and Celebration of the Holy Sacrament of the Body and Blood of <hi>CHRIST.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> This Enumeration is not ſufficient; for why, the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Baptiſm is omitted, no reaſon is given, but the Author in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to Treat on no other Heads, but ſuch as he hath named, I ſhall paſs it, though other ſubſtantial parts of Worſhip are alſo left out.</p>

               <head>CHAP. I. Of Praiſes.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>PAge</hi> 6. The Author doth forthwith fall upon the offering up of Praiſes to God by the uſe of Pſalms, and for its Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty quoteth 2 <hi>Chron. 29. 30. Hezekiah the King, and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, commanded the Levites to ſing praiſes to the Lord, with the words of</hi> David <hi>and</hi> Aſaph, <hi>and they ſang with gladneſs; and</hi> Epheſ. 5. 19. <hi>and</hi> Col. 3. 16.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> To all this we agree, knowing it our duty to praiſe God by ſinging the Pſalms of <hi>David.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But Page 7. Though the Scriptures recommend to us ſinging of Pſalms, yet in ſome caſes they allow us to ſay them:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Who doubteth but we may Read or Say Pſalms, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in publick or privat: But, <hi>2ly,</hi> This <hi>ſaying Pſalms,</hi> is not to turn out <hi>ſinging</hi> of Pſalms, which is the ordinance of God: I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten read of <hi>ſinging,</hi> but no where in Scripture of <hi>ſaying</hi> Pſalms: what induceth the Author to make ſo great a trouble to himſelf and his Reader, I underſtand not; only I know Papiſts have a way of Singing, and muttering Pſalms, and Songs in their Worſhip.</p>
               <p>But I find our Author reſolved to proſecute this Saying inſtead of Singing; for,</p>
               <p>Page 8. <hi>'Tis certain the Word of God recommends to us Pſalms and Hyms in proſe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and as to the Hebrew Pſalms it's evident they are Poetical, but the Poetry of them conſiſts rather in the ſtile, and manner of expreſſion, than in any certain meaſures or Verſes.</hi> And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, <hi>we cannot find that the Church in our Saviour, or the Apoſtles time, did ſing any thing in Verſe, but we are ſure they ſung Hymns in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:97381:8"/> Proſe So that we have no certain Scriptural Warrand for the uſe of Verſe or Metre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Author hath raiſed a Duſt, which himſelf cannot blow away again, and all for <hi>ſaying</hi> in place of <hi>ſinging,</hi> in a moſt unnatural, harſh, ruſtick manner; whereas we are all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with a more decent, melodious manner of ſinging the Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of God.</p>
               <p>But he ſaith, <hi>God hath recommended to us Pſalms and Hymns in Proſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> God recommendeth to us the ſinging the Pſalms of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> which at God's direction were in Metre, and therefore ſhould be Tranſlated into Metre; that they ſhould be fit for ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in our Language, as they were ſung by the people of God in the Hebrew, that being their Language.</p>
               <p>The Author confeſſeth <hi>the Hebrew Pſalms were Poetical, but not Verſes or Metre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is a contradiction, and as much as if he had ſaid, they were Poetry and not Poetry; for Poetry is an Art of making Verſes, by its Definition: Therefore to ſay that Poetry is in the loftineſs of the ſtile, and manner of expreſſion, is without colour; if Poetry want its numbers, pauſes, and meaſures; which are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led its feet, it falleth, and is no more Poetry, therefore the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Word properly ſignifieth a Pſalm, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Cantus poetica ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te concinnatus ab amputare praecidere,</hi> wherein pains is taken to have it fitted for Melody, by cutting off what will not ſerve the due meaſures of Verſe. 2. The frequent directing the Pſalms to the chief Muſicians, for publick Worſhip, is an undenyable Evidence that the Hebrew Pſalms were ſung Muſically; The Melody of their ſinging was ſo pleaſant, that ſtrangers required to hear their Songs, not for the Matter, but for the Muſick, and were it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, many Teſtimonies might be adduced for confirmation of this, that the Hebrews did ſing their Pſalms in Metre, <hi>Gomarus in prefat, ad lyram Davidis,</hi> Quoteth <hi>Hieron: in prefat ad librum Job: &amp; Philo Jud:</hi> and many others for it.</p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:97381:9"/>
               <p>But the Author cannot find <hi>in the Primitive times they ſung in Verſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Becauſe they did ſing Pſalms, therefore they ſang Verſes, the Hebrew Pſalms being formed by the direction of God in Verſes to their hand.</p>
               <p>But ſaith he, <hi>we are ſure they ſang in Proſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> But his ſaying ſo cannot make his reader ſure, one argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would do better than if he ſhould ſay twenty times <hi>he is ſure,</hi> yet upon his own inviſible aſſurance, he affirmeth that we have no certain Scriptural warrant for the uſe of Verſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Our Scripture warrant for ſinging Metre is plain, becauſe firſt the Pſalmes of <hi>David</hi> in Hebrew are Metre. <hi>2ly.</hi> We are commanded to ſing theſe Pſalms. <hi>3ly.</hi> Finding them in Metre they muſt be tranſlated into Metre, that we may ſing them with under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in our own language, and melodiouſly as the nature of that Duty requires.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Page</hi> 9. He formeth an objection, that I think neither worth his forming, nor my anſwering, <hi>viz. That ſome may fancy Verſe was not in uſe in theſe countries, and therefore they ſang in Proſe; to this he anſwereth, that Poetry was then at the highest perfection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Author begs the queſtion, as if it were granted they ſang all in Proſe, which we deny; but <hi>2ly.</hi> If Poeſie and Muſick was ſo much in faſhion they had been the more to blame, if they rejected a decent, and practiſed an indecent, and unnatural way of ſinging; And the next is no better, <hi>viz;</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If the Holy Ghoſt had thought Verſe neceſsary, he would have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired ſome holy-men to tranſlate the Pſalms into Verſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> There is no need of extraordinary inſpiration when the light of Nature, and it's improvement by induſtry, can reach the end; therefore this argument is not Cogent; and his next objection is worſe, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the Prophets of the heathen wrote their Propheſies in Verſe to their gods: We know not but this may be a reaſon, why the Holy Ghost
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:97381:9"/> thought fit that ſuch as were inſpired by him ſhould decline that way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> He ſaith <hi>we know not,</hi> and <hi>may be,</hi> but are theſe arguments? to what purpoſe ſhould any man anſwer <hi>may be?</hi> Yet <hi>2ly.</hi> his <hi>may be</hi> is too far, eſpecially conſidering that God had already directed the Pſalms of <hi>David</hi> to be Muſical; and next, becauſe this is an unwarrantable encroachment upon the reaſons and thoughts of the Majeſty of God.</p>
               <p>The Author cometh next to reſponſes in the Praiſes of God <hi>Page 10th. As the Scriptures preſcribe, as the uſe of Pſalms in the Praiſes of God, ſo they encourage us to offer theſe Praiſes by way of reſponſes or anſwering, for this we have the best example can be deſired, even the bleſſed Angels and glorified Saints, ſo</hi> Jſa. 6. 3. <hi>And one cried to another, Holy, Holy, Holy, is the Lord of Hosts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Author mounteth too high in ſeeking a Seraphick pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern, for though they <hi>be glorious</hi> Spirits, yet the argument after exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination will be found but <hi>a glorious flouriſh;</hi> and for this particular Scripture quoted, I ſhall make it appear there are no reſponſes in it; firſt in the Original <hi>he to him</hi> though the tranſlation wordeth it <hi>another;</hi> yet there is no more in the Text but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>hic ad illum.</hi> one crieth, but no other anſwereth; therefore there is no reſponſe, <hi>2ly.</hi> Reſponſes amongſt men require ſome difference in the matter; but all that is cried is <hi>one thing</hi> in the Text, no variation of a word. <hi>3ly.</hi> Reſponſes require ſpeaking Succeſſivly, one after another, but there is no ſuch thing in this Text, this then prejudgeth the reader, to name a Text for probation of that which nothing in it can prove, and ſo impoſe on inconſiderat People, as if all were made good by Scripture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>4ly.</hi> Tho' there were alternal Praiſes by Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phims, yet Seraphick Praiſes are no pattern to us, for Stated wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip on earth, as God willing, ſhall further appear in anſwering to the Next.</p>
               <p>Page <hi>10th. And the Church triumphant through the whole relation is (I think) conſtantly repreſented praiſing God after this manner ſo</hi> Rev. 7. 9. <hi>the multitude that repreſent the people, cried with a

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. The Author ſuppoſeth without any Proof, that theſe Scriptures ſpeak of the Church <hi>Triumphant;</hi> but judicious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentators, and many of them judge, that both theſe Scriptures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to the <hi>Militant Church;</hi> in the <hi>7th Chap.</hi> They are Praiſing for the begun deliverance from <hi>Antichriſt:</hi> Tho' the expreſſions of their praiſes be in Heavenly terms, ſuch as the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently uſeth of the Goſpel Church, as <hi>Iſa. 35. 10, 25, 8, 51. 11. &amp;c.</hi> Becauſe theſe praiſes ſhall be perfectly accompliſhed in Heaven; and it's obſervable, that in the two laſt <hi>Verſes</hi> of that <hi>7th.

               <p>As for <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. That the ſtate of the Militant Church is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood there, the Text it ſelf maketh it undenyable; for after the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of the ſeat of the beaſt, other enemies are found gathering to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the beaſt, and making up Armies to fight againſt the Church, as is clear from <hi>verſe 19th</hi> of that <hi>Chap.</hi> Therefore this cannot be the Church Triumphant: the Author hath an eaſie cuſtom of quoting many Texts without explication, or pondering, whether ſuch Texts be real proofs of what he aſſerteth, or not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2ly.</hi> There being ſuch grounds to judge that theſe two Chapters quoted by the Author, ſpeak of the Church Militant, then let it
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:97381:10"/> be conſidered, when or where could that multitude meet together of all Nations, whom no man could number for ſtated Worſhip, is this imaginable?

               <p>If the Author will have it ſo, that the Triumphant Church is meant in theſe places, though Armies be found gathering againſt Chriſt and his Church, though it were ſo (which cannot be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) yet the Heavenly Hoſt of Angels and glorified Spirits, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be their manner of Worſhip and Adoration, it can be no Pattern to us; becauſe</p>

                  <hi>First,</hi> There is <hi>no Temple there, Rev:</hi> 21. 22.

               <p>
                  <hi>2ly,</hi> It hath pleaſed God to give us a compleat Pattern for his Worſhip already, ſo that we need not ſay, <hi>Who ſhall go up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3ly,</hi> The Scriptures contain the Revelations of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s Will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his Worſhip; but the Scriptures do no where reveal this, that the Worſhip of Angels is to be imitated by us; Do you know how to place your ſelves about the Throne? Have you Crowns to caſt down before the Divine Majeſty? Have you Palms in your hands and white Robes? Men have need of ſobriety in drawing Arguments from Symbolical, or Enigmatick Theology.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>4ly,</hi> The Laws for their Worſhip is not only unknown to us, but they are not Laws to us; and therefore it's but preſumption to make them Laws to our ſelves.</p>

               <p>

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> As for ſinging the Pſalms of <hi>David</hi> to the Praiſe of God, we know it's our duty both in Publict and Private.</p>
                  <p>And it's to be obſerved, <hi>2ly.</hi> Theſe Pſalms he acknowledgeth are <hi>appointed,</hi> but the Hymns are only <hi>recorded</hi> in the <hi>New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> but all Hymns <hi>recorded</hi> are not <hi>appointed</hi> to be ſung by others, as the Pſalms of <hi>David:</hi> therefore he hath Cautiouſly expreſſed this, the one is appointed, the other but recorded.</p>
                  <p>Page 15. <hi>Our Church has thought fit to require us with every Pſalm and Hymn, to intermix glory to the Father, to the Son, and to the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Theſe words are good in themſelves, but to intermix them with the words of Gods immediate dictating, is meer <hi>Invention</hi> of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:97381:15"/> men, and done only by the <hi>commandment</hi> of men; for it's making that a part of worſhip which God hath not Inſtituted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>2ly.</hi> Let it be obſerved how this doth contradict what the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor himſelf laid down, as a foundation to his whole work: for <hi>Page</hi> 3. It's ſaid <hi>without adding,</hi> and here <hi>our Church has thought fit this be intermixed.</hi>

                  <p>As for <hi>ſinging or ſaying in Proſe,</hi> there needeth no more than what is replyed already.</p>

                  <p>There is no more in this Section that requireth anſwer.

Then it followeth, according to our Author, that ſome pure immediat Inventions of men, are not unlawful in the Worſhip of God; to what purpoſe ſhould he emit a Book, pretended againſt the inventions of men in the Worſhip of God; and yet that which himſelf calleth <hi>purely and immediatly the invention of men, is not unlawful,</hi> by the Author's own words?</p>

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Is this the <hi>Spirit of meekneſs,</hi> we heard of a little ago, if he would not have his Reader believe it, why doth he write and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh it? and if he would have the World to believe it, then they ſhall believe that which is not Truth? for I know Meeting-houſes not far from him, where the Book of Pſalms is ſung every Lords Day in order, ſome portion of them, I ſay, every Lords Day, from the beginning to the end of that Book, tho ſome others uſe their liberty in ſinging ſuch Pſalms as are moſt agreeable to the Doctrine then Preached.</p>
                  <p>As to what he ſaith of the Dr. <hi>Manton</hi>'s calling the Debate of ſinging Proſe or Metre <hi>a vain Cavil:</hi> It had been good for our Author he had been of the ſame mind, I will take no further no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Page</hi> 21. The Author complaineth heavily of the Tranſlation of Pſalms into Metre, ſaying, <hi>We have a Command to Tranſlate the Pſalms, but none to turn them into Metre:</hi> and again in the ſame page, he ſaith, <hi>it ſeems to give Humane wit too great a liberty of treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Word of God as men pleaſe.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>2ly,</hi> What the Author ſaith of the danger of Tranſlating into Metre, doth militate againſt all Tranſlations; for often many words muſt of neceſſity be uſed for Tranſlating ſo conciſe a Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage as the Hebrew; and yet no wrong done to the Text: Let the Author alſo remember what himſelf hath ſaid, page 14. <hi>That if there be any miſtake through humane frailty, not contrary to Faith, this ought to be no exception against the uſe of the Tranſlation,</hi> the ſame ſerveth alſo for Tranſlating into metre, they cannot ceaſe to be the words of God, becauſe they are Tranſlated into metre, for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons already adduced.</p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:97381:16"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>3ly,</hi> The Author appeareth under ſome Grievance, as to the Tranſlation of Hebrew Pſalms into metre; ſome of them, as he ſaith, <hi>hardly doing justice to the ſenſe of the Text.</hi> If he be concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in any ſuch Verſion of Pſalms, he would do well to endeavour a rectification; for it hath been ſaid by judicious perſons of his own perſwaſion, there is need for it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>4ly,</hi> And if the Author will lay aſide prejudice, and be ſo hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as to accept of Relief from his Grievance, I would recommend unto him a Verſion of the Pſalms into Metre, practiſed by us, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act to the Hebrew Text, and ſo exact, that the Author may ſpend time worſe, than peruſe and compare it with the Hebrew, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he ſhall not find varying from the Original, nor unintelligible nauſeating Expreſſions.</p>
                  <p>5ly, The Author is ſo diſguſted with the Pſalms in Metre, that he ſaith, <hi>Page 21. We ought to uſe them as Humane Compoſures on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and not as Gods Word, and ſo they are uſed by our people in our Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, not as any main ſubstantial part of the Worſhip of God; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as a voluntarie entertainment of Devotion, and a refreſhment to the people, between the parts of the Service,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is odd confuſion concerning Worſhip, as ever I heard, for by the Author's words, ſinging praiſes to God in metre, is <hi>Worſhip,</hi> &amp; yet 'tis <hi>not Worſhip;</hi> I prove both from what he ſaith: Firſt, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth it to be <hi>Worſhip,</hi> but it's not <hi>a main ſubſtantial</hi> part of Worſhip, then its Worſhip, but not main Worſhip<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was ever ſuch lame Worſhip heard of before? Yet 2ly, Its not <hi>Worſhip,</hi> but a <hi>voluntarie entertainment</hi> and refreſhment; that is, its a voluntar Service, but not poſted as commanded Worſhip.</p>
                  <p>2ly, Will the Author ſay that a neceſſary Tranſlation of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal into words, intelligible by us, and in metre, according to the Original, doth deveſt it from the dignity, of being ſtill the Word of God? he may as well ſay our Bible is not the Word of God, becauſe its not Hebrew and Greek, but only Engliſh.</p>
                  <p>3ly, If the Author be ſatisfied that ſinging Pſalms in metre is
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:97381:17"/> not Worſhip, then why doth he obtrude it on God on any accompt, for he ſaith, page 22. That <hi>this ſinging in Metre is at preſent in uſe, both with you and us:</hi> why doth he not bring forth his ſtrong rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to convince the Church of <hi>England</hi> that they are all in <hi>Errour,</hi> and himſelf only in the <hi>Right?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. Shall mens <hi>recreations</hi> and diverſions, he made ſtated wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to God? and why ſhould the poor people be impoſed on? for they take it for due worſhip as <hi>commanded</hi> of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Page</hi> 23. There is nothing but what is already anſwered, only two unjuſt Imputations.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>That for as much as appears, we have laid aſide the Pſalms in Proſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ:</hi> Can the Author keep a good Conſcience in Tranſmitting this to ſtrangers, and following Generations? Let the Reader there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (if a ſtranger, for no other will give it credit) know that we read frequently the Pſalms in Proſe, from the beginning to the end, in our publick Lectures, that we often chooſe our Texts in the Book of Pſalms, and moſt frequently quote them in Preaching, for clearing and confirmation of our Doctrine, we are ready to give many thouſands of unexceptionable Witneſſes to atteſt it; how then doth it appear that we have altogether <hi>laid aſide</hi> the Pſalms in Proſe.</p>
                  <p>The next aſſault is, <hi>that we ſing but a few Verſes of a Pſalm,</hi> Page 23.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Author hath brought no light <hi>how many</hi> ſhould be ſung, and they are never like to be the moe, for what he hath ſaid, ſeing he neither hath nor can warrantably preſcribe the quantity.</p>
                  <p>Yet, <hi>2ly.</hi> For the undeceiving of Strangers, let the Reader know that commonly we ſing the Praiſes of God with the words of <hi>David</hi> four times each Lords day in Publick; and at each time commonly much more for quantity than the Author nameth.</p>
                  <p>3. That for ordinary we ſing theſe Pſalms in our Families dayly, and orderly from the beginning to the end of that Book; We wiſh we could ſay as much of thoſe of another perſwaſion, and that they were taught by word and example ſo to do; For <hi>in dwellings of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous </hi>

                     <hi>ſhould be heard the voice of melodie and Praiſe,</hi> and now being thus provoked I am free to aſſert, and that not at random, that there are moe of the Pſalms of <hi>David</hi> ſung in one of our Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations every day, than in the Authors whole Dioceſe (as his) in a week, Churches and altogether: and 'tis no wonder, when I remember the words of the Author, <hi>Page</hi> 180. In his epiſtle to the conforming laity of the Dioceſs of <hi>Derry,</hi> wherein he ſaith, <hi>and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I would adviſe you to make uſe of the words, with which our Church hath furniſhed you in your houſes, as well as in the Church,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and at more Solemn times, I conceive our Litany is as full and proper a ſervice as any maſter of a Family can deſire to offer to God.</hi> Here is no advice to uſe the word of God as immediatly dictated by him, either in reading or ſinging of Pſalms.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>4ly.</hi> But ſinging is not all our praiſing in Publick, finding it our duty Solemnly to give thanks to God for the great Salvation by <hi>Chriſt:</hi> which in our Publick worſhip is commonly practiſed.</p>
                  <p>There is no more in this Head but what is anſwered already, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing being ommitted, that hath the colour of an argument, the Author concludeth this chapter perſwading himſelf his arguments will prevail: let him pleaſe himſelf with his own thoughts; only I muſt ſay, that ſince I begun to Examine what is ſaid, I have not found one argument that he can rationally expect will prevail with any judicious reader, ſo that the Author by all his Elaborat diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes hitherto, hath inſtead of promotting his cauſe, done con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable diſſervice to his friends in urging.</p>

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:97381:18"/> were for that time expedient; as in the beginnings of Reformation, when Prieſts could perform little more than read; but that is no warrant for the continuation of ſuch forms, when God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided qualified Miniſters for Miniſterial duties, and far leſs can it be a warrant for Impoſing ſuch Humane Compoſures on all Miniſters of the Goſpel, as terms of Communion.</p>

                  <p>2ly, It's ignominious to the Son of God, to ſay that he uſed forms of Prayer; ſince all forms have been preſcribed for the help of weak ſinners: This fondneſs for forms, I ſee, ruſheth men into dangerous precipices; for 'tis not ſafe to caſt ſuch an imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on him, who is the <hi>Wiſdom of the Father;</hi> and if the Author ſhall ſay, that though <hi>Chriſt</hi> needed not forms <hi>Himſelf;</hi> yet he might uſe them for example to <hi>others</hi> to uſe Forms.</p>

                  <p>Page 31. The Author cometh at laſt to put the matter out of debate.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Our Saviour hath put this matter out of all diſpute with impartial men, by preſcribing a form to his Diſciples, when they deſired him to teach them to pray.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let the Reader obſerve a few things, before I come to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Anſwer.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the Lords Prayer being a Form and Pattern from <hi>Chriſts</hi> own Mouth, we judge our ſelves obliged to a great vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration thereof.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This Pattern being a ſum of all we are to pray for, we judge no Prayers warrantable, but ſuch as are agreeable unto it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We are ſtill to pray this Prayer, albeit we uſe not its preciſe words.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That this ſame Prayer may be warrantably prayed in its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:97381:21"/> words <hi>verbatim,</hi> is acknowledged, and that none ſhould be offended when it is ſo uſed, providing it be uſed with reverence, and duly placed in the Worſhip of God.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Authority is ſo great, and the Inſtitution ſo plain, that if we be not warranted by the ſame Authority to uſe theſe, or other words in Prayer; then we ſhould be indiſpenſibly obliged to uſe theſe very words preciſely.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. But if the <hi>ſame Authority</hi> allow us to uſe other words, though ſtill the ſame Prayer, then the obligation to the <hi>ſame words only ceaſeth;</hi> and none ſhould be offended when other words according to the ſame pattern, are made uſe of in Prayer.</p>
                  <p>Remember alſo to obſerve the Author's Conceſſions already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, as to all forms of Prayer.</p>
                  <p>And another Conceſſion in the general, <hi>Page</hi> 153. which will contribute to clear the Subject in hand.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Yet in a controverted place of Scripture concerning the meaning of a Command of</hi> Chriſt, <hi>relating to ſome poſitive duty,</hi> I <hi>take the conſtant practice of the Church from the Apoſtles downward, to be a good means of determining the ſenſe of it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Author had done well to make the Reader underſtand more diſtinctly what he is diſputing for; if this be his Theſis, that no words in Prayer are lawful, but the words of the Lords Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, let him ſpeak it out, and hold by it; for he often giveth his Reader ground to think ſo by his Arguments, particularly Page 33. and 35.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things being premiſed, I ſhall now, God willing, give particular anſwers.</p>
                  <p>Page 31. The Author ſayeth, <hi>For we find his way of Teaching them, was not by directing them to wait for the impulſes of the Spirit, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediat Inſpiration:</hi> and afterward, <hi>but preſcribing them a form of words, and commanded them to uſe it,</hi> Luke 11. 2. <hi>And he ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, When you pray, ſay,</hi> Our Father which art in Heaven, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Author's terming the aſſiſtance of the Spirit of Grace, <hi>wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:97381:21"/> for impulſes and immediat inſpiration,</hi> is unſavoury at beſt; for if he mean the way of <hi>Quakers,</hi> who will not pray, before they be previouſly moved by impulſes, it is not candid in him to throw this imputation on others, who diſown that manner of wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: But</p>
                  <p>2ly, We are obliged to pray and wait for the aſſiſtance of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Grace and Supplications, <hi>Chriſt</hi> having <hi>promiſed to give the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost to them who ask him,</hi> Commanding expreſly to <hi>wait for his promiſed Spirit, Acts</hi> 1. what ever extraordinary Gifts were then to be given, yet the Spirit of Prayer was included, as was found by experience afterward; ſo that expoſing of this <hi>waiting</hi> without due caution, is dangerous, eſpecially in an age when profane <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſts</hi> are ridiculing all the gracious Operations of the Spirit of Grace as <hi>Enthuſiaſm,</hi> and ſo to have us back to <hi>Heatheniſm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. Tho we are not now to wait for <hi>extraordinary and immediat Inſpiration;</hi> yet we are to wait for the <hi>ordinary</hi> aſſiſtance of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Grace and Supplications, promiſed to all Believers.</p>
                  <p>The Author quoteth <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. 2. but not <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 9. which ſaith, <hi>after this manner therefore pray ye.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was not fair to cover this Scripture, which giveth occaſion to remember another of our Authors Imputations, <hi>page</hi> 95. where he chargeth us with a deſign of concealing Scripture. (how unjuſt the world knoweth) however, the keeping up of the parallel Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to <hi>Luke</hi> 11. is <hi>a concealing</hi> of Scripture in the very ſeaſon when it ſhould be publiſhed: did not the ſame mouth which uttered theſe words, <hi>ſay,</hi> utter alſo theſe words, <hi>Pray after this manner,</hi> are they not of equal Authority? and equally neceſſary for the Reader to underſtand?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. No man will ſay this variation in the very entry of the Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, was fortuitous or unneceſſary; but for ſome peculiar in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction to the followers of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that they might underſtand how to improve this pattern of Prayer.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Therefore we owe as great veneration to the words of <hi>Chriſt, Matth.</hi> 6. 9, as to his words, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 2.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Christ</hi> himſelf in the Inſtitution maketh a conſiderable alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:97381:22"/> of the words, which plainly evinceth that it was not ſo much meer <hi>words,</hi> as matter and <hi>ſubstance</hi> that Chriſt taught his Diſciples.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That the difference as to words is Conſpicuouſly great, let them be particularly conſidered.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Math. Hath, <hi>After this manner,</hi> Luk. hath, <hi>ſay.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 Matth. Hath, <hi>Give us this day our daily bread.</hi> Luke hath, <hi>day by day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3 Matth. <hi>Forgive us our Debts.</hi> Luk. <hi>Forgive us our ſins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Matth. <hi>As we forgive our Debtors.</hi> Luk. <hi>For we alſo forgive every one that is indebted to us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Matth.</hi> Hath a large concluſion, <hi>For thine is the Kingdom, and the Power, and the glory for ever</hi> Amen. <hi>Luke</hi> Hath no concluſion, nor ſo much as, <hi>Amen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. The difference then being ſo great <hi>in wording</hi> of this Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it muſt ſome way be inſtructive to us, none daring Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, or profanely to ſay, it flowed from a negligent omiſſion: That then which natively appeareth is, that it was never Chriſt's deſign to limit us to <hi>bare words:</hi> Why is it delivered to us in <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent words?</hi> But to ſhew we may uſe <hi>different words,</hi> and keep by the matter.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Whichſoever of the Evangeliſts a man ſhall follow in this Prayer, he ſhall be conſtrained to uſe different <hi>words</hi> from the other Evangeliſt, and yet both are the Inſtitution of Chriſt; Therefore by Chriſts Inſtitution, <hi>different words</hi> are warrantable in praying this Prayer, ſeing the Inſtitution it ſelf is in <hi>different words.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. If it had been Chriſts mind that only theſe <hi>preciſe words,</hi> ſhould be uſed in Prayer, then the Apoſtles would have uſed theſe <hi>words of Prayer,</hi> for as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>we have the mind of Christ;</hi> but we do not find that the Apoſtles in their Prayers, ever made uſe of theſe very words, it cannot be ſaid they <hi>prayed none,</hi> for we have their Prayers recorded; It cannot be ſaid that they <hi>forgot,</hi> or were negligent of their Maſters command, for great grace was upon them all; it cannot therefore be ſaid that they were <hi>left of God,</hi> to their inventions <hi>in prayer,</hi> for God did ſhine upon them, and helped them to pray with great ſucceſs, and immediatly after
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:97381:22"/> their <hi>praying,</hi> they were filled with the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 30. Yet in all theſe <hi>Prayers</hi> we find not <hi>the Form of the Lords Prayer</hi> uſed by any of them as to it's words, tho' none ſhould doubt their keeping by the matter.</p>
                  <p>Now let the Author ſay plainly whether the Apoſtles <hi>ſinned</hi> in not uſing that Form of words? or if they did ſhake off the badge of their profeſſion, by omitting to uſe theſe words? For the Author calleth <hi>this Form of prayer the badge of our profeſſion:</hi> If he ſay they got extraordinary help for <hi>Prayer,</hi> I would ſoon anſwer, that the more bountieful their Maſter was to them, they ſhould have been the more tenacious of any thing concern'd his honour, as a Badge of their profeſſion.</p>
                  <p>Add to all this our Authors Conceſſion above-mentioned, <hi>that the practice of the Apoſtles, is the beſt way to know the meaning of a poſitive command;</hi> let him now make application, for the conſtant manner of the Apoſtles <hi>praying</hi> was by uſing <hi>other words.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p n="3">3. The Inference the Author draweth from this, is not native, but forced, when he ſaith, <hi>which ſhews that even the unlearned had a part aſſigned them in the Chriſtian Aſsemblies,</hi> for it cannot be thought
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:97381:26"/> that a part of Worſhip was aſſigned to ſuch as did not underſtand the Worſhip; and it is of ſuch that this Text ſpeaketh, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood not what they heard.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Author cannot prove that it was ordinary in all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Aſſemblies, to uſe this word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>Let the Reader take this which I now write as an anſwer to the Authors Argument, but not pleading for the diſuſe of that word, <hi>Amen,</hi> either in publick or private Worſhip.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ:</hi> 1. If all extemporary Prayer depend only on the thoughts of the ſpeaker, without any divine aſſiſtance, this is a plaine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of the Spirit of prayer, which the Author in heat for forms falleth into inadvertently, and militateth againſt all manner of extemporary Prayer, which yet himſelf acknowledgeth not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If the Author ſay, <hi>they are uncertain to the hearers,</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, let the Author ſay plainly, whether this <hi>uncertainty</hi> be a ſufficient Argument, that there ſhould be no extemporary Prayers in the publick Worſhip of God or not; for if the argument ſayeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, it is this, becauſe extemporary Prayers are uncertain, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſhould not be uſed, where others are to join with them; if the Author would ſay, either the one or the other, and ſtand by it, I would know where to find him; but ſometimes I find him ſaying, as <hi>page</hi> 54. That he doth not condemn extemporary Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers as unlawful, and there may be ſome men able to expreſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſignificantly and decently <hi>ex tempore;</hi> and at other times u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Arguments againſt all ſuch Prayers, as if none of them were law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; Who can Divine what he would be at? for he will neither have nor want theſe Prayers.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If the Author tenaciouſly urge this argument of uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that being <hi>uncertain,</hi> the people cannot joyn with them; and ſeing the people cannot joyn with them, therefore they ought not to be in the publick Worſhip of God: I anſwer ſtill, this argument is againſt all extemporary Prayer in publick; and then 1. This is a condemning the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who deprive not the Church of God of this benefit. 2. It contradicteth the Authors own fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Conceſſions. 3. And is againſt the manner of praying in the Apoſtles time, when the Apoſtles prayed publickly, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were obliged to joyn in their hearts, and ſo they did with one accord; yet they knew not what would be uttered before they heard it: ſo your people know not your new Forms of Prayer, before they be uttered in publick; and when any of your Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:97381:27"/> pray <hi>ex tempore,</hi> the people know nothing of it before theſe words be ſpoken, which they are preſently to joyn with.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If what a man heareth in Prayer be not Orthodox, he is not obliged to joyn with it.</p>
                  <p>What he hath more in this Section, is anſwered already, only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain and again he telleth the World that all he aſſerteth is <hi>war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by Scriptures:</hi> Whereunto I anſwer, (as he often giveth oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion) that the Scriptures quoted by him, are no way appoſite to his purpoſe: for which I crave no better than a <hi>judicious Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> who will be at the pains, to review the Scriptures quoted, and the anſwers given.</p>
                  <p>Laſt of all, he ſaith, <hi>Our firſt Reformers had not retained Forms of Prayer, had they not found ſuch in Scripture.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ:</hi> This <hi>retaining,</hi> mentioned by the Author, is ſignificant, it appeareth then that theſe Forms were in uſe before the Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by whom were they uſed? We can know of none that uſed theſe Forms before the Reformation, but <hi>Papiſts;</hi> and if the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor direct us to the <hi>Maſs-Book</hi> for the Original of theſe Forms, which he ſaith was <hi>retained</hi> by our firſt Reformers, he deſerveth no reward from his Brethren, for probably many of the vulgar were ignorant of the riſe and beginning of ſo many Forms of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, before the Author gave this hint.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>And first for that Poſition of your Directory, that the Spirit of Prayer is given to all the Children of God in ſome meaſure, for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling their hearts to conceive, and their tongues to expreſs conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent deſires to God; I intreat you to conſider what promiſe or founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it has in Scripture, I profeſs to you ſeriouſly, that upon the ſtricteſt enquiry I could make, I never could find any ſuch promiſe made to all the children of God, in the</hi> Old <hi>or</hi> New Teſtaments</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ:</hi> The Author Prefaceth this part of the diſcourſe, with a promiſe to endeavour the repreſenting of our way, with all fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and impartiality, but in the very entry this is forgot; for he giveth not the words of the aſſembly truly as they are ſet down by them, therefore the Reader ſhall have them in the words of the Compilers.</p>
                  <p>Poſition, 9. <hi>So many as can conceive prayer, ought to make uſe of that gift of God: albeit thoſe who are rude and weak may begin at a ſet Form of prayer, but ſo as they be not ſluggiſh in ſtirring up in themſelves (according to their daily neceſſitie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Spirit of prayer, which is given to all the children of God in ſome meaſure. To which effect, they ought to be the more fervent, and frequent in ſecret prayer to God, for enabling their hearts to conceive, and their tongues to expreſs convenient deſires to God for their Family.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe are the expreſs words of the directory, let the reader com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the words of the Author, with the words of the Direction, and he will find them very unfairly repreſented, for they Say <hi>men ought to pray, for enabling of their hearts to conceive and their tongues to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, convenient deſires to God;</hi> but the Author, repreſenteth them, Saying <hi>this is the poſition of the Directory, that the ſpirit of prayer is given to all the Children, of God in ſome meaſure for enabling their hearts to
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:97381:28"/> conceive, and their tongues to expreſs,</hi> there is Vaſt Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween praying that enabling, <hi>may be given,</hi> and that it is <hi>already gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet I ſhall freely eſpouſe all that the Reverend Aſſembly hath Said, and hope to make it appear by plaine Scripture, that the Spirit of God is concerned in the matter, manner, and the words of believers Prayers alſo, for the proof thereof conſider.</p>
                  <p>Gal. 4. 6. <hi>And becauſe ye are ſons, God hath ſent forth the ſpirit of his ſon into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By which Scripture theſe three things are evident, 1. That the Spirit of prayer is given to the Children of God. 2. that the ſame is given to all the Children of God. 3. That the Spirit of God is concerned in their words of prayer.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt, the Children of God, being called ſons, the Spirit of Chriſt the eternall Son of God, is Sent forth into their hearts, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they cry, <hi>Abba, Father;</hi> this crying <hi>Abba, Father,</hi> is prayer, which none can deny, and is beſtowed upon the adopted Sons or Children of God.</p>
                  <p>For the ſecond, that all the Children of God receive this Spirit of prayer, is alſo manifeſt, ſeing this aſſiſtance of the Spirit is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>becauſe</hi> they are Children <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; therefore to all the Children, every child of God being in a ſtate of adoption, this help is appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated unto him, as reſulting neceſsarly from his adopted State, tho the <hi>meaſure</hi> of his aſſiſtance be according to the gift of Chriſt, yet the meaneſt of them are not deprived thereof, all of them hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſpirit of adoption, which is confirmed by Rom, 8. 15 <hi>But ye have received the ſpirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.</hi> So then all of the Children of God have the Spirit of Adoption, and this Spirit of Adoption enclineth and enableth all who have it to cry unto God.</p>
                  <p>For the <hi>3d.</hi> That this Same aſſiſtance of the Spirit, is concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the words of their Prayers, I prove from the ſame Scripture, becauſe it's by the help of the Spirit they cry <hi>Abba, father,</hi> here are <hi>words</hi> in Prayer prompted by the Spirit of God: and if any ſhould ſay that theſe words are but few. I anſwer, they are Sufficient
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:97381:28"/> to evince that the Spirit of God is concerned in the very words his Children ſhal ſpeak to him in Prayer, and So our moſt Judicious Commentators expound theſe words, that the Spirit of God concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelf with the very words of believers Prayers.</p>
                  <p>Here then the Reader may ſee all that is aſſerted by the Aſſembly, evident by plaine Scripture; and moreover a great encouragement for all the Children of God to expect aſſiſtance to the very words of their Prayers, when God calleth them to ſpeak in Prayer, and all this without dependence on the Words of a Form.</p>
                  <p>And let the Reader obſerve, that our Author appeareth of the ſame mind, by what he aſſerteth Page. 5, 4. In theſe words <hi>there may be ſome men tho not very many, able to expreſs themſelves Significantly and Decently</hi> ex tempore, <hi>and there are ſome occaſions that require it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in publick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; on theſe occaſions when a man hath not time allowed him to reduce his deſires into form before he offers them, he may depend on the aſſiſtance of God's Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From which words I infer, that then there muſt needs be ſome promiſe of the aſſiſtance of Gods Spirit for Prayer in publick, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a form; for no man can warrantably depend for that which is not promiſſed by God, but we may hopefully depend on the aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of Gods Spirit for Praying in publick, without a form.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the aſſiſtance of Gods Spirit for praying publickly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a form is promiſed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> If the Author, or any other Say, that this dependance, for the aſſiſtance of the Spirit in publick prayer, without a form, is but allowed at Some extraordinary times.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> We are at no time warranted to depend for that which is not promiſed, for we cannot depend in faith, where there is no promiſe; and yet the Author ſaith, we may depend for it, take notice of <hi>Deut. 15. 6. The Lord thy God bleſſeth thee, as he promiſed thee,</hi> Its by promiſe we have a Saviour, and with him all Spiritual bleſſings Acts. 13, 23. <hi>Of this mans ſeed hath God according to his promiſe, raiſed unto Iſrael a Saviour Jeſus,</hi> there is no hope but by the Covenants of promiſe. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2, 12. So <hi>David,</hi> found
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:97381:29"/> in his heart, to Pray for the eſtabliſhment of his houſe, becauſe God had revealed and promiſed it, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7, 27, 28.</p>
                  <p>Hereby alſo we may See where the preſumption, he mentioneth is to be placed, for the mantainers of this Scripturall Doctrine, have faithfully performed their duty in making it known to the world; neither is the aſſiſtance of Prayer by an extrordinary gift, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all the Children of God, as hath been evinced; and for further Confirmation of the Same aſſertion Condſider, <hi>Rom. 8. 26. Likewiſe the Spirit alſo helpeth our infirmities, for we know not what we ſhould pray for as we ought, but the Spirit it ſelf maketh interceſsion for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.</hi> Verſ. 27. <hi>And he that ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, becauſe he maketh interceſsion for the Saints accoding to the Will of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In which Scripture theſe 4 things are clear. 1. That the beſt of Saints on earth ſome times know not <hi>what</hi> to ask of God. <hi>2ly.</hi> That the <hi>Spirit</hi> helpeth their infirmities. <hi>3ly.</hi> That this help of the Spirit is ſo efficacious and prevalent, theſe Prayers are the <hi>mind of the Spirit,</hi> and called his <hi>interceſſion. 4ly.</hi> That theſe prayers by this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſiſtance, are according to God, or the will of God.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt of theſe they know not <hi>what</hi> to ask, obſerve, its not ſaid, they know not <hi>how,</hi> or in what Spiritual or acceptable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but <hi>what</hi> to ask.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The forms of Prayer preſcribed by God, were then extant, known and regarded by the Saints; yet they knew not <hi>what</hi> to ask.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This ignorance <hi>what to ask,</hi> could not be as to generall peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, for the Lords Prayer expreſſeth all the general Petitions which we are to pray for.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Neither the Apoſtle nor any other Saints ſhould ask any thing of God, but what was comprehended in theſe general Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 Therefore their ignorance what to ask muſt be, what <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi> mercies to ask <hi>hic et nunc</hi> according to their various neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Tho they did know their various emergent, particular neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:97381:29"/> mercies, were <hi>virtually</hi> contained in the form of the Lords Prayer, yet they thought it not ſufficient only to repeat the <hi>words</hi> thereof, but found it their duty to have an explicite Diſtinct conception, of theſe <hi>particular mercies,</hi> their preſent exigencies required.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The apoſtle and other Saints found themſelves at a loſs, without <hi>Divine Aſſiſtance</hi> to diſcern what particular Mercies were moſt neceſſary and Seaſonable, for them to Pray for, and therupon acknowledge, they know not <hi>what to ask.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing to be obſerved in this text is, the Supply of this defect by the Spirit of God, enabling them what to ask as they ought, becauſe <hi>he helpeth their infirmities,</hi> whatever other help they had by the Spirit, as to their tryalls. <hi>2ly.</hi> Yet this helping of their infirmities, is alſo relative to their Praying, as is evident by the particle <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, for we know not what we ſhould Pray, ſo that this help is a cure to their ignorance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a levamen or ſupport, as the word beareth curing this infirmity, <hi>but the Spirit helpeth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. This help is given to all the Children of God or Saints, as this text nameth them, the Apoſtle including himſelf with the reſt, to reſtrict this help to ſome eminent Set of believers were meer violence to the text, and full ſcope of the place; for this help belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to them who are Saved by hope Verſ. 24. And afterward Verſ. 28. <hi>To ſuch as love God, and are the called according to his purpoſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. When the Spirit helpeth, <hi>what</hi> they ſhall Pray, this is a diſtinct help from the <hi>manner</hi> of Praying Spiritually with the heart, grace, deſire, fervencie, for this Praying with grace in the heart is expreſſed, by theſe words, <hi>with groans that cannot be uttered:</hi> ſo that the help of the Spirit, is not only to Pray with grace in the heart, but as to the matter of Prayer alſo.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Seing the Spirit of God giveth help to his Children as to <hi>what</hi> they ſhall ask, then there is no warrand or reaſon to reſtrict this help to <hi>mental Prayer only;</hi> but that he helpeth them to Pray, which way ſoever God <hi>calleth</hi> them to Pray, he who giveth <hi>what</hi> to ask, giveth alſo to <hi>ſpeak</hi> it, when he <hi>requireth ſpeaking</hi> and that the Spirit of God is concerned in the very words of the prayers of his Children
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:97381:30"/> hath been made out already from Gal, 4, 6. Hoſe. 2. 23. <hi>And they shall ſay, Thou art my God</hi> Jer. 3. 19 <hi>Thou ſhalt call me, my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> &amp;c Iſa. 12. 1. <hi>And in that day thou ſhal ſay, O Lord, I will praiſe thee: though thou waſt angry with me, thine anger is turned away<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> and thou comfortedſt me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is not preſcribing them a form but what the Spirit of God ſhall prompt them to ſpeak to him, <hi>we ſpeak words which the holy ghoſt teacheth.</hi> 1 Cor. 2, 13.</p>
                  <p>The third thing in the words is that the Prayers of believers, by this Aſſiſtance is called the <hi>Interceſſion of the Spirit,</hi> which ſhould be carefully underſtood, becauſe its Chriſt who is our interceſſor, yet the Spirit of Chriſt given to all who are in him, being the Spirit of Grace and ſupplications, is ſo much intereſted in the Prayers of his People, both as to <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> that its called his interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, albeit Payer be <hi>formally</hi> the act of the believer,</p>
                  <p>2. Seing the Spirit of God is ſo deeply concerned in the Prayers of believers, that their Prayers by his help is ſaid to be the mind of the Spirit, and the Prayer being dignified, with the name of the Spirits interceſſion; then it muſt follow that the believer is enabled in all the neceſſary parts of Prayer as <hi>God calleth him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But many pretenders to the Spirit of Prayer do profane Prayer, and utter ſuch words as the Spirit of God, will never eſpouſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> That many pretend to the Spirit of Prayer who are Senſuall not having the Spirit, who will deny? we undertake no defence of ſuch perſons, but regret it as no Small part of the worlds Sin, and miſery.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But becauſe there are ſuch profaners of the holy Spirit, it doth not follow, that we may neglect &amp; deſpiſe that moſt neceſſary aſſiſtance, ſeing God hath ſo clearly and fully promiſed the Spirit of Prayer, to all his children, and we commanded to pray in the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Men who ſpeak in Prayer before others, ſhould be warrantably aſſured that God <hi>requireth it of them,</hi> for if God do not call to ſpeak
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:97381:30"/> in Prayer, they cannot ſafely expect his aſſiſtance therein, all the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God are not called to ſpeak in Prayer publickly, their hearts may be enabled to conceive prayer in ſecret, who could not do ſo in publick, God not requiring it of them: it were preſumption to attempt that which God calleth them not unto.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 If any man uſe expreſſions in prayer contrary to the revealed will of God, and the analogie of faith, or ſuch as are not agreeable to the nature of prayer, or ſcurrilous impertinencies, ſuch as inevitably rendreth the Prayer contemptible; ſuch a man is ſo far from Praying by the Spirit of God, that where it can be hindred, he ſhould not be ſuffered ſo to profane that holy duty.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 As God diſtributeth Spirituall gifts to his children according to the ſervice he hath for them, ſo they are diſpenſed according to the meaſure of the gift of Chriſt, tho all the Children of God have <hi>ſome meaſure,</hi> yet not all <hi>alike meaſure,</hi> therefore ſome may abound more both in the gift, and grace of prayer, than others who are alſo ſincere.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Many have no expreſſions in Prayer, but ſuch as are Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox, and pertinent, to the nature of Prayer: yet if they be but plain without the words of mans wiſdom, eſpecially if they be ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, ſavouring of the power of the Spirit of Grace; carnal men are ready to call ſuch Prayers flat, mean, and indecent, for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſon, but that <hi>a natural man diſcerneth not the things of God, for they are fooliſhneſs unto him, neither can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I muſt go forward, leſt this little piece of Work prove big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, than I deſigned, therefore ſhall not now inſiſt upon that other great and gracious Promiſe.</p>
                  <p>Zech: 12. 10. <hi>And I will pour upon the houſe of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jeruſalem, the Spirit of grace and ſupplications.

                  <p>The Author could not find out <hi>one</hi> ſuch Promiſe, now he hath <hi>moe,</hi> much good may they do him, and much of that Spirit of Grace
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:97381:31"/> and Supplications be upon us all; and this we will by Gods grace perſwade our People to depend upon, as a rich and precious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God <hi>to all the Children of God;</hi> and therefore not by <hi>extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Inſpiration,</hi> as the Author giveth out.</p>
                  <p>Page 45. He ſaith, <hi>Neither is there any command in Scripture, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring us to worſhip or pray to God in a conceived extemporary, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premeditated Prayer, or ſo much as an example in a ſettled ordinary Congregation where it was practiſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ:</hi> If all conceived Prayer be deſtitute of the Command of God, then all Extemporary Prayer muſt neceſſarly be Will-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and therefore unlawful: Why then did the Author ſay, <hi>page 54. That extemporary prayer was not unlawful;</hi> for my heart I cannot get his words cemented; for to ſay, <hi>its not unlawful in worſhip,</hi> and yet <hi>no Command of God for it,</hi> cannot be reconciled. Yet</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This which the Author ſaith, That <hi>there is no command of God for ſuch prayers,</hi> is no leſs than to charge all in the Chriſtian World as guilty of Will-worſhip, when ever they uſe extemporary prayers.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Is there no Command to pray without a Form? <hi>Job</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to pray for his Friends, let the Author ſhew by what form he was to pray, or what form was extant for ſuch an unparallell'd Caſe, <hi>Jer.</hi> 29. 7. The Prophet requireth the people carried Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to <hi>Babylon,</hi> that they ſhould pray for the peace of the City, where they were Captives; where is the form by which they ſhall pray? They are commanded to pray, but we find no form preſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them: plenty of ſuch inſtances might be given, where men are commanded to pray, but no colour of any form of words.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. As for examples, <hi>where extemporary prayers were uſed in Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations:</hi> he cannot but know that all the Records we have of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick prayers in the New Teſtament, are <hi>all without a form of words;</hi> this therefore is inadvertently urged by the Author, becauſe it plainly croſſeth his deſign.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Page</hi> 46. We have a new Argument for forms; which is but loſt labour, Diſputing againſt no opponent: when he ſaith, <hi>who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever prayeth to God with faith, ſincerity, fervency, love,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:97381:31"/> acceptably to God, and that one praying by a form may have all theſe qualifications.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ:</hi> All this being conceded, what gaineth the Author? ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he would make it appear, that no man hath theſe qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, who prayeth without the words of a form, which can never be proved; and the more the Author eſſay it, he ruſheth ſtill the deeper in contradicting his own words, whereof he hath been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten minded; he expreſly ſaith, <hi>page 49. The Spirit of Prayer is the Grace, the heart, the diſpoſition and ability to pray; and whether it be with, or without a form, ſuch a mans prayers are acceptable to God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Since then that Prayers by the help of the Spirit are <hi>accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God without a form;</hi> Why doth the Author make it his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire concern to Diſpute againſt ſuch Prayers as he acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, are <hi>acceptable unto God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. He doth not find us aſſerting, That all Prayers by a form, are unacceptable to God; but as our Larger Catechiſm, ſo we ſay, That the Lords Prayer may be uſed as a Prayer, and hereby that venerable Aſſembly of Divines has left it, as their Maſter <hi>Christ</hi> left it, when his people pray, either to <hi>ſay</hi> the words, or to pray af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>this manner.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Page</hi> 47. The Author ſaith, That we ſing forms of Prayer, <hi>The Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters make no ſcruple to turn theſe Forms of Prayer into Metre, and then ſing them Line by Line after the Miniſter</hi> and quoteth the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the fifth Pſalm.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ:</hi> We ſing the words of the Pſalms, becauſe we are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſing them, whether they be <hi>materially</hi> Praiſes or Prayers, they are <hi>formally</hi> Pſalms, by the Inſtitution of God, and ſo we uſe them: ſo that this argument is of no weight.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As for our manner of ſinging, one line being read after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, we allow it as an expedient for Edification, that theſe who ſing, may thereby have the more time to conſider what they ſing, in the praiſes of God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Its ſtrange inadvertency to find the Author ſo frequently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing that manner of ſinging, which he confeſſeth is uſed by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, how the Church of <hi>England</hi> will be ſatisfied with ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections,

                  <p>But theſe extemporary Prayers are moſt unhappy things in the Author's Eye; For</p>

                  </p>

                     <hi>Anſ:</hi> 1. That conceived Prayes may want Spiritual qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, is not doubted, and ſo may Prayers by a Form; theſe <hi>may be's</hi> ſay nothing, men may be mockers of Prayer, both without, and by a form: But what followeth, ſhall men therefore neither pray by a Form, nor without a Form?</p>
                  <p>2. For that Obſervation, that <hi>a man may make long prayers, and yet devour widows houſes?</hi>

                  <p>I <hi>Anſ:</hi> 1. That the Queſtion under Debate, is not about long or ſhort prayers, and how it dropeth in here, I know not, for its impertinent to the Subject in hand: But 2. That ſuch who make long prayers, may devour Widows Houſes by injuſtice, breach of Covenants, and oppreſſion, I doubt not, for many poor Souls find it ſo at this day, and do now complain of it.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ:</hi> The ſcope of that Scripture will ſhew the Authors miſtake<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe the ſinging and praying mentioned in that Scripture, are by <hi>immediat inſpiration,</hi> as is acknowledged by all; and therefore neither their ſinging nor praying could be by any <hi>ſet form;</hi> but as the Spirit of God did inſpire it; only for the profit of others, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle inſtructeth to ſing and pray with underſtanding: This <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding</hi> in this place, being paſſively taken, that is, ſo as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers might underſtand what they ſpoke, by their extraordinary Gifts: its evident then they followed no ſet form of words, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                  <p>The Author then hath no help for Forms from this Scripture, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there occaſion for contrary Interpretations, neither the ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nor praying here being <hi>by forms.</hi>

                  <p>Page 50. <hi>We find the moſt ſpiritual perſons addreſſing themſelves to God in forms, our Saviour himſelf on the Croſs, when in his agonie, he repeated theſe words,</hi> Pſal. 22. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ:</hi> 1. Here is the moſt flouriſhing, but yet the worſt argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for Forms that the Author hitherto hath brought to the field; becauſe Forms of Prayer are for the uſe of theſe who need forms; but its indignity done to the Son of God, to put his Name in the Role of Creatures, ſtanding in need of a Form.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Chriſt</hi> uſing the words of that Pſalm, was, becauſe they were a Prediction of himſelf, ſpoken by <hi>David</hi> in <hi>the perſon of Chriſt,</hi> ſaying alſo in the ſame Pſalm, <hi>they pierced my Hands and my Feet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. If it ſhould be ſaid that <hi>Chriſt</hi> uſed the words of that Pſalm, not for any need of a Form to himſelf, but to teach others to make uſe of Forms. I anſwer, This cannot be, becauſe our Saviour would not teach any other man to uſe theſe words in a Form, which did properly and only belong to himſelf, for no man was to uſe theſe words as they there predicted, but he who did bear upon him the wrath of the Almighty, for the ſins of the Elect.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. There is great difference between Predictions, what <hi>Christ</hi> would ſpeak on Earth, and ſetting forms, directing him how or what to ſpeak; the Scriptures concerning <hi>Chriſt</hi> behoved to be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled by him, but not as forms.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>And to pray with this grace, is to pray in and with the Spirit, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we uſe words or no; and if we do uſe them, whether we reduce them

                     <hi>But then its manifest that this was an extraordinary gift of God, and a part of propheſie, and we may not Depend on the holy Ghost for this gift.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>2ly.</hi> The Apoſtle found theſe <hi>Pſalms, Doctrines,</hi> &amp;c. very unready, as being yet in an unknown tongue, and not fitted to the peoples underſtanding, ſo that the Author can get nothing gathered here
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:97381:33"/> for forms, but he is to be excuſed; for the field is bare and can Spare nothing to him.</p>
                  <p>Page: 53. <hi>But further that place</hi> Eccl: 5, 1. <hi>Seems to me to afford a ſtrong argument againſt ſuch Prayers. When thou goeſt to the houſe of God be not raſh with thy mouth, and let not thy heart be haſty to utter anything before God</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. And yet a ſtrong argument againſt Such Prayers as he hath ſaid, are acceptable to God. Should not the Author ſtand in awe to write againſt what is acceptable to God?</p>
                  <p>2. As for raſhneſs in ſpeaking before God, we are all concerned obediently to advert unto this Direction: and let the reader obſerve that a form in Prayer may be obſerved as to words, when there is neither reverence to God, nor Underſtanding of what men ſpeak, and ſo all they ſpeak be found raſh on the ſpeakers part, ſo alſo men may be guilty of the ſame raſhneſs when they pray without a form; if they ſet not before their eyes, the rules God hath given to direct us in Prayer, and depend not on the promiſed help of the Spirit of grace and Supplications: But.</p>
                  <p>Page 54. <hi>I appeal to you whether it would not be looked on as raſhneſs, for an ordinary perſon to ſpeak to a prince, or Solemn aſſembly concerning a matter of great moment, in words unpremeditated and unformed</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> This again is another argument againſt all extemporary Prayer, it wearieth me to write ſo often the Author's inconſiſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, for if this argument ſpeak any thing, its againſt all conceived Prayer, &amp; that every man Since the creation of the world Sinned, whoever ſpake to God without a premeditated form, Godly Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah, and many others are now condemned, he when delivering the cup to the King being ſore afraid prayed forthwith unto the Lord, without time for premeditation, yet the church of God had publick benefite by this Prayer, tho he was ſore afraid of the King; yet he could be free with his God, as knowing his neceſſitie could admit of no delay, being conſtrained to anſwer the King im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly, and yet would not anſwer before he ſent up his deſire to God: if we were all better acquainted with frequent Praying,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:97381:34"/> making our requeſts known to God in every thing, we would not have ſo much noiſe of the words of <hi>Forms.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the ſame <hi>Page</hi> we have his ample Conceſſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But in aſmuch as God has not expreſly forbidden all extemporary prayers, I would not be underſtood by this to condemn all ſuch as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull: there may be ſome men (tho' not very many) able to expreſs themſelves ſignificantly, and decently,</hi> ex tempore, <hi>and there are ſome occaſions that require it even in publick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Here is ſuficient ground to confute all the arguments the Author hath hitherto brought againſt Extemporary prayers, which I leave to the diſcerning of the judicious Reader. But he addeth,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And on theſe occaſions, when a man has not time allowed him to reduce his deſires into Form, before he offers them, he may depend on the aſsistance of God's spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> And needeth he not depend on the aſſiſtance of God's Spirit after he has reduced his deſires into a Form, if the form be once attained. It will do for it ſelf, but hath not a man as much need of the Spirit of God to help him by a Form as without it, ſhall we ſay that the words of a Form will do the whole work.</p>
                  <p>From this <hi>Page</hi> to the end of this Chap. I find little argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative, and therefore ſhall ſoon diſpatch what remains.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Page</hi> 55. and 56. He hath two conjectures concerning other mens prayers, the one concerning Miniſters <hi>praying in publick, that ſome of them compoſe forms of prayer, &amp; then pray according to theſe forms.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> I know no way he hath this, if it be not by ſome perſonal experience.</p>
                  <p>The next is <hi>Page</hi> 56. Where the Author ſaith, <hi>that good men who make conſcience of ſecret prayer to God, do by degrees fall into a Form.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> I give this the ſame anſwer I gave the other conjecture, and perſwade my ſelf that as the Author wordeth it, it is the very way of a decayed Soul; for if men ſhall obſerve their daily recent mercies, and how badly improved, and if even the remarkable ſins of every day be noticed as they ought, if men be deſiring to grow in Grace, if men obſerve the temptations whereby their Souls are
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:97381:34"/> hurt, the binding up of ſuch by the words of a Form, would be a very bondage.</p>
                  <p>I muſt alſo ſay that the Scope of this diſcourſe, I will not ſay of the Author, but that the <hi>intentio operis</hi> is againſt the very power of Godlineſs; And to reduce us all to bare Form of words, not only in publick, and in our Families, but in ſecret alſo; and ſo to be <hi>praeterea nihil nothing but Forms,</hi> as Papiſts are at this day: And therefore it concerneth us all to take notice of the warning given us 2 <hi>Tim. 3. 5. That in the last days perilous times ſhall come,</hi> wherein amongſt other evils it is ſaid, <hi>ſome ſhall have a Form of Godlineſs, but denying the power thereof: from ſuch turn away.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For all the Author hath ſaid, that extemporary prayers are not unlawfull, and that they are acceptable to God, if there be Grace in the heart: Yet no ſtone is unturn'd againſt them, but all aſſaults hitherto want ſucceſs, therefore once more.</p>
                  <p>Page 56. <hi>Let me obſerve that the uſe of extemporary conceived prayers, even in caſes of neceſſity, is founded on a general rule of Scripture only, which commands us to ask of God what we lack;</hi> And a little after, <hi>general commands ought only to take place in ſuch caſes, where God has not laid down a particular rule.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. This poſition doth again cut off all liberty for conceived prayer in publick or privat, for tho' there be a general command to ask what we need, yet now there being <hi>a particular rule</hi> for a Form, the general command is thereby Exhauſted, and ſo by the Author there is no room left for any manner of prayer, but the Form.</p>
                  <p>2: If a particular ſubſequent command evacuate the general, then it followeth that when God requireth us <hi>to call upon him in the day of trouble,</hi> that we ſhould not call upon God at <hi>any other time,</hi> but in the day of trouble, this being a particular command, under the general command of calling upon God; which particular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand doth evacuate the general; for it <hi>taketh no more place</hi> as the Author ſaith. So is a man call upon God in the time of health and proſperity, he hath no command for it, and ſo is but will-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, the inference is <hi>genuine,</hi> and let the Author ſee to its Solution.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Page</hi> 57. The Author ſpeaketh to a ſecond ſuppoſed exception of diſſenters againſt Forms.</p>

                     <hi>I come now to ſpeak to the ſecond, that all Forms of prayer are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful to Chriſtians, and that it is a ſin to joyn in a worſhip where they are uſed, or ſo much as to be preſent at it.</hi>

                  <p>Page 59. <hi>There neither is, nor has been, any eſtabliſhed Church theſe 1500. Years, but has maintained their lawfulneſs, and uſed them in the ſervice of God, that is Forms of prayer.</hi>

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1: The Author wrongeth his Reader in confounding, but never diſtinguiſheth <hi>Divine Forms</hi> from <hi>Humane Compoſures.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2: We uſe <hi>Divine Forms</hi> in publick Adminiſtrations, and therefore are not divided from other reformed Churches on that Head, as was inſtanced in all our publick Adminiſtrations.</p>

                  <p n="4">4. If by Forms of prayer the Author underſtandeth <hi>Humane Compoſures</hi> and <hi>publick Liturgies,</hi> I deny they took place in the Church of God for many Centuries after Chriſt.</p>

                  <p>Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> in his Hiſtory aſſerteth, <hi>that publick Liturgies came not under publick conſideration for 400. Years after Chriſt, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Centuries after, before</hi> Gregories <hi>compoſure was eſtabliſhed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I find no further in the following <hi>Pages</hi> of any new Argument requiring notice, till we come to</p>
                  <p>Page 63. <hi>And I dare appeal to your ſelves, whether ſome very Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moral perſons, guilty of groſs and Scandalous Crimes, have not been eminent for this gift of prayer, and whether ſuch perſons are not apt to flatter themſelves that they are the Children of God, and endued wih his Spirit notwithſtanding all their wickedneſs: and it is Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible either to convince theſe perſons of their miſtake, or to comfort
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:97381:35"/> poor Ignorant people dejected only for want of this gift, whilſt they are poſseſſed with this opinion of the unlawfulneſs of Forms.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Some by Nature and its improvement by multiplied Acts, acquire an habit of ſpeaking more orderly, and decently than others.</p>
                  <p>2. Such perſons being Educated Chriſtians, by profeſſion, and having occaſion often to hear, ſpeak, read and converſe, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious things, may ſpeak of the matters of God, whether to God or men, much more pertinently and fluently than others: and have no more but a natural gift themſelves remaining immoral and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.</p>
                  <p>3. And being pinched by affliction may pour out prayers, with great natural fervour, or in expectation of the applauſe of men may ſpeak in prayer, to the Admiration of others; and yet all this but natural acquiſition, and no ſpecial gift of the Spirit of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>3. Beſides theſe improvements of nature, our Saviour Chriſt having received gifts for men, and beſtowing them on whom he will, for the good of his Church; thereby many have been endued with common gifts of the Spirit of Chriſt, whereby others are edified, but not themſelves, they being ſtill deſtitute of the ſpecial Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Grace of the Spirit, and ſuch as Chriſt will ſay unto at the laſt, depart I know you not: tho' their partaking of theſe common gifts, was the occaſion of their concluding themſelves in a State of favour with God, miſtaking thoſe common gifts for ſuch as are ſpecial, and Sanctifying: ſuch perſons never being converted to God, and truely Sanctified, may notwithſtanding of all their common gifts, be lewd and Scandalous in their practice.</p>
                  <p>5. Whatever judgment we may paſs upon our ſelves, yet we are not ſo much concern'd to judge by what gifts other men do pray, or if they have the grace of prayer together with the gift, is not our part to ſearch: tho' it be certain that where the converſation is ordinarly ungodly and vicious, whatever gift a man hath, yet he wanteth the Grace of prayer.</p>
                  <p>6: When ſuch immoral perſons are endued with a common gift of the Spirit, enabling them to ſpeak pertinently in prayer; ſure
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:97381:36"/> it is not that gift, which maketh them Immoral and Scandalous, nor is the Gift of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be deſpiſed on that account: for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon gifts ſanctifie no man, tho ſuch as God hath honoured with them are the more guilty, for profaning of his mercies, and their ingratitude to God.</p>
                  <p>7. Only Believers in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> who are ſanctified by the Spirit of Grace, partake of the grace of Prayer; and as the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of this Grace pleaſeth to imploy any of them in his ſervice, for the good of others, ſo he beſtoweth the gift alſo, in what mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure he pleaſeth.</p>
                  <p>As for perſons who are dejected for want of a Gift of Prayer, they have need of ſound and skilful advice; for the meer want of ſuch Elocution as others have, ſhould not diſcourage them, tho all ſhould covet the beſt Gifts: But</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If perſons have no Inclination, nor help by the Spirit of God to pray unto him, there is juſt cauſe for fear, but not deſpair; I ſay juſt cauſe for fear and grief of heart, becauſe all the Children of God have the Spirit of Prayer in ſome meaſure; yet no cauſe for deſpairing, becauſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath promiſed the <hi>Holy Ghost to them who ask him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. To direct ſuch perſons only to the words of a Form, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver prove a cure to their Souls: <hi>For if any man have not the Spirit of Chriſt, they are none of his;</hi> therefore ſuch perſons ſhould be exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to cry unto God for the Spirit of grace and ſupplications.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Page</hi> 63. The Author once more urgeth the uſe of forms in Prayer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A great part of the world cannot do it without a form, Children and ignorant perſons are at a loſs for words.</hi>

                     <hi>Anſ:</hi> As for young and very ignorant people, we allow them the uſe of forms, until God enable them more; but withal exhort them to further progreſs, leſt if they ſhould ſtill reſt upon forms, they ſhould be ſatisfied with a form of Godlineſs only: But</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ:</hi> This is not the firſt of the Author's miſtakes, that we have
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:97381:36"/> ſeen, for we have occaſion to know what they do in the ſervice of God, better than he; and I am well aſſured of the contrary of that he aſſerts; he affirmeth, not knowing what they do, and I affirm upon knowledge, that commonly our Children, ſo ſoon as capable, are helped with ſome eaſie and ſhort forms, and that many of them dayly bow their knees to their Maker, and are cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſed if it be neglected.</p>
                  <p>The Author cometh often over this, our Teaching the unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of forms, which is impoſing upon his Reader, for none of us Teach any ſuch Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>Page 65. <hi>There remains yet the third Opinion of Diſſenters, which they advance against us in this matter of Prayer, to be examined, that the Miniſter is the mouth of the Congregation, and that the people have nothing to do, but to join with him in their hearts, an opinion far from any au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Scripture, which expreſly requires us,</hi> Rom: 15. 6. <hi>with one mind and one mouth to glorifie God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ:</hi> It's not long ſince we ſaw this under the Author's hand, <hi>Page</hi> 36. That <hi>generally there is no more neceſsarie, but that the people joyn in their hearts, except it be on ſome occaſions;</hi> and when theſe occaſions appear, we will conſider his Opinion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2: In all Goſpel publick Worſhip recorded in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; we find no more either required or practiſed, but <hi>the peoples joining in their hearts.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>But the Concluſion muſt ſtand, whether the Premiſſes, will or not; that the Authors way of Worſhip is agreeable to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God; let the Reader judge by the Anſwers, if eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of his Probations hath not failed him: I do ingeniouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, That I have not ſo much as found difficulty in any of his Arguments, wherewith he chargeth us as guilty of <hi>the Inventions of men in the Worſhip of God;</hi> but <hi>I</hi> queſtion if ever amongſt Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, a Book was publiſhed, wherein moe of the <hi>inventions of men</hi> hath appeared, or a wider <hi>Door</hi> opened for <hi>all manner of humane Inventions,</hi> than by the Diſcourſe now under conſideration.</p>

                  <p>PAge 68. <hi>one great deſign of our Chriſtian Aſſemblies is hearing; and that which is to be heard is the word of God:</hi> Firſt, <hi>then God hath poſitively commanded us to read his word, in our publick Aſsemblies, ſo</hi> Deut. 31. 10. <hi>In the feaſt of Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles when all</hi> Iſrael <hi>is come to appear before the Lord thy God, in the place where the Lord ſhall chooſe, thou ſhalt read this Law before all</hi> Iſrael <hi>in their hearing. ſo</hi> Joſh. 8. 35.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Neither was this confined to their ſolemn Aſſemblies at</hi> Jeruſalem: <hi>it was likewiſe a conſtant part of their ſabbath ſervice in their ſyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, as we may learn from</hi> Acts 13. 14.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. That the word of God ſhould be read in our publick Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, we are agreed, for Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To read the whole Law of God at once in our Aſſemblies, is not practicable.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Some conjecture what was read in the ſynagogues; but tho' it were ſure can be no rule to us.</p>
                  <p>Page 69. <hi>This reading of the Law, was the great, and moſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual means God provided, for preſerving the knowledge of himſelf amongſt his People, and the beſt reformation began, and was carried on by reſtoring this ordinance: thus it's obſerved of</hi> Joſiah 2. Chr. 34. 29. <hi>The like is obſerved of</hi> Ezra. Nehem. 8. 3.</p>
                  <p>Page 70. <hi>From the practice of the ſynagogue in reading the Law and the Prophets the like order was brought into the Christian Church: and hence it is that</hi> Timothy <hi>is commanded</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 13. <hi>to give attendance to reading</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And the inſpired writings of the Apoſtles

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1: The reading of the word of God is certainly his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and that both in publick and private, and the people of God may warrantably expect a bleſſing by it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>2ly:</hi> But that the <hi>meer reading</hi> was the moſt effectual mean, will not be ſo eaſily granted, for God did ſee it neceſſary to provid Prophets of old, to explain the Laws of God to his people, to exhort, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, threaten<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and comfort them, as the Law of God required<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not only to predict and propheſie (as it's taken ſtrictly) what was to come upon them: but to <hi>interpret, and preſs obedience to the Law of God:</hi> and accordingly the Levites not only read the Law, but gave the ſenſe, and made the people underſtand the reading, not only the ſenſe of hard words, but as it is <hi>Neh:</hi> 8: 7: made them <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand</hi> the Law.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>3ly.</hi> It cannot be the bare <hi>reading</hi> of the Law, for <hi>David</hi> had the reading of the Law plentifully, both in publick, and in private, yet he found not that of it ſelf <hi>ſufficient</hi> for underſtanding of the Law, and did know that except he <hi>underſtood</hi> the Law; the reading of it would not be the moſt effectual mean, and therefore prayeth unto God <hi>Pſ: 119: 18.

Then opened he their underſtanding, that they might underſtand the Scriptures;</hi> Chriſt knew it was <hi>more than poſsible</hi> for them to be ignorant of their duty; by only reading, or hearing the Scriptures read.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>4ly.</hi> Do not ſome who have the reading of Scripture, yet being unlearned, and unſtable, wreſt them unto their own deſtruction? Is it impoſſible that theſe people be ignorant of their duty? 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 16.</p>

Timothy</hi> I yield, is commanded to give attendance to <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi> and no doubt to reading in publick, as the edification of his hearers required; but that the reading mentioned in the Text is, only <hi>publick reading</hi> cannot be inſtructed, for he was to be diligent in reading privatly alſo, in order to his further accompliſhment for Miniſterial work.</p>

We have a new and rare opinion broached; I ſhall give you his own words. <hi>This publick reading the Law, was of ſo great reputation, that it is Termed, Preaching it, as we may ſee from</hi> Acts 15. 21. <hi>For</hi> Moſes <hi>of old time, hath in every City them that Preach him, being read in the ſynagogues every ſabbath day; the word</hi> Preaching <hi>has a peculiar ſenſe in the</hi> New Teſtament, <hi>and ſignifies properly to declare, or proclaim the Word of God, as a Herauld or Cryer proclaims the laws or orders of a King.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ:</hi> If theſe New Dictates be received, they have an evident tendency to deprive men of the great mean of their Salvation, which is preaching; for <hi>it pleaſed God by the fooliſhneſs of preaching,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 21. <hi>to ſave them that believe.</hi> But by the Author, none of us can be ſaved now <hi>by preaching,</hi> except it be by <hi>hearing of the Law read,</hi> we cannot have other preaching; for we in theſe Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have heard the Goſpel already preached, and we can have preaching no more but at the firſt. What cruel Divinity is this to the ſouls of men? the caſe is plain, for God <hi>ſaveth by preaching;</hi> and the Author ſaith we have <hi>now no preaching,</hi> nor ſhall ever have hereafter, becauſe its long now ſince it was firſt preached to us; and all we can expect is, the reading of the Law, but no preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

                     <hi>preaching:</hi> So that here we have one place where the Goſpel is <hi>preached</hi> to theſe who heard it <hi>before,</hi> by the proper word which the Author ſeeketh after; for he had been three years amongſt them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which was more than once, as a Herauld publiſhing a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, and ſo be gone: Neither could this preaching be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a reading of the Law; for the Apoſtle preached the <hi>Kingdom of God, and faith toward Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> verſe 21.</p>
                  <p>2ly, The Apoſtle had preached ſo frequently amongſt them, that they were now a formed Organical Church, with their Officers, Presbyters, whom <hi>verſe</hi> 28. He calleth Overſeers or Biſhops, and to them the charge of the flock was committed, no man will ſay, that all this was done by <hi>once</hi> Preaching to them.</p>
                  <p>3ly, That <hi>preaching properly</hi> was to continue in the Church of God, where it was neither <hi>reading</hi> the Law only, nor the <hi>first</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing of the Goſpel, I prove from 2 <hi>Tim. 4. 2. Preach the word, be inſtant in ſeaſon, out of ſeaſon, reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering, and dostrine;</hi> by which Scripture, theſe two things are clear: 1. That the Evangeliſt <hi>Timothy</hi> was appointed to <hi>preach</hi> the Goſpel, and that was more than to <hi>read</hi> the Law. 2. That he was to <hi>continue</hi> preaching, which was more than <hi>once,</hi> as a Herauld to publiſh the Goſpel, and ſo have done. For the firſt, That he was appointed to preach, is the plain word of the Text. And it is again <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and that it was not to read the Law only, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, for in the next <hi>verſe</hi> he is required to do the work of an <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelist,</hi> which was to preach the Goſpel. 2. He was to improve the Gift God had given him by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the Presbytery; this <hi>Gift</hi> was more ſure; than to be a <hi>good reader,</hi> he had learned that when young. 3. He was right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>divide</hi> the word, this was more than <hi>reading,</hi> his preaching then was more than to read the Law; for 1 <hi>Tim. 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>. Theſe things command and teach,</hi> viz. That Chriſt was the Saviour, as the words immediatly preceeding ſhew.</p>
                  <p>The next thing to be made out is, That <hi>Timothy</hi> was to <hi>conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue</hi> preaching, ſo the Text ſaith, <hi>be inſtant,</hi> ſtand to it, as the word beareth, <hi>in ſeaſon, out of ſeaſon;</hi> therefore preaching was
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:97381:39"/> to be his ordinary work, while he was in the Miniſtry; and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, but not granting, that <hi>Timothy</hi> was to be <hi>fixed Biſhop</hi> at <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus,</hi> as is aſſerted by theſe of the Prelatick perſwaſion: then I demand of the Author, if <hi>Timothy</hi> was never to preach the Goſpel <hi>but once</hi> at <hi>Epheſus?</hi> to be a <hi>fixed</hi> Biſhop, and yet preach <hi>but once,</hi> is ſtrange! If the Author ſay, That after his firſt preaching, he migh <hi>interpret, exhort,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Anſwer,</hi> But the Text ſaith, <hi>preach;</hi> And why ſhould any preſume to alter, or give it a leſſer name than the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> hath given it? 2. It ſhould be obſerved here al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that after the Apoſtle hath ſaid, preach; then he brancheth out its ſeveral parts, <hi>reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all longſuffering and doctrine:</hi> All which are parts of Preaching, being performed by a Miniſter in his publick Adminiſtrations. This Text then doth plainly yield us <hi>preaching,</hi> where it was neither <hi>reading of the Law,</hi> nor the <hi>firſt</hi> publiſhing of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>I might add many other Scriptures which overturn the Authors aſſertions, as <hi>Acts 5. 42. And dayly in the Temple, and in every houſe, they ceaſed not to teach, and preach Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> this was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>reading</hi> the Law, nor <hi>once</hi> preaching, ſeing it was <hi>dayly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Acts 28. 30. And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired houſe, preaching the Kingdom of God,</hi> this was neither <hi>reading</hi> the Law, nor <hi>once</hi> publiſhing the Goſpel; for it cannot be thought, that the firſt publiſhing would take two whole years, in one place; the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor had done well to let the world know, <hi>how long time</hi> the firſt publiſhing did require? but he hath needleſly run himſelf into this Thicket.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Acts 3. 20. And he ſhall ſend Jeſus Chriſt, which before was preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto you;</hi> and yet the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> was at this time <hi>preaching</hi> unto them himſelf, as is evident from the 2 <hi>verſe</hi> of the next <hi>Chap: The prieſts and Captain of the Temple came upon them, being grieved that they taught the people, and preached through Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus the reſurrection from the dead.</hi> Here then is <hi>preaching</hi> to ſuch as heard before. I need waſte no more time on this, though I could inſtance <hi>Philip</hi> his preaching to the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> where <hi>Chriſt</hi> had preached before: And let the Reader obſerve, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:97381:40"/> I have quoted for preaching, are theſe very words in the Original, which the Author required. I might alſo here ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Authors words at the beginning of this next Section, the words are [The practice of our Church in reading and <hi>preaching</hi> the word] theſe of his Church had the Goſpel preached to them long <hi>before now,</hi> and yet both reading and preaching remaineth with them by his own words; How cometh he to have preaching now? ſeing its neither reading of the Law (for they have reading beſides) nor is it the firſt publiſhing of the Goſpel, for his people heard the Goſpel, before he was a preacher to them: if in this caſe preaching properly be not found in the New Teſtament, Then whence hath he his preaching? how unhappy a thing it is to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpouſe a bad Cauſe! He may now ſee that no ſucceſs attendeth his labour, and let never man have better ſucceſs, in attempting to deprive the Churches of God, of continued Goſpel preaching; I ſay, <hi>preaching properly,</hi> according to the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>Pſal. 71. <hi>Tho reading the Scriptures is called preaching, yet interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, applying them, or exhorting the people from them in a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Auditory, is never called preaching.</hi>

                     <hi>2ly.</hi> Why then ſaith the Author, <hi>Page 159. Tho' we are yet too far ſhort of the Primitive practice and inſtitution;</hi> can none come nearer Scripture rules and Inſtitution, and yet yourſelves too far ſhort of the Inſtitution? Let any who can, reconcile theſe.</p>

It cannot be your Copy, for others read more, nor can it be theſe who read more, for according to the Author, none can come nearer the rule than you, and yet the reaſon he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth for this, is much <hi>reading</hi> only.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>6ly.</hi> Theſe come not neareſt the rule who read <hi>too much,</hi> and more than God hath given direction to read, as any part of his Service or Worſhip, but you know who read <hi>Apocrypha</hi> in God's publick Service, which he hath given no rule for, therefore ſuch come not neareſt the rule.</p>

                     <hi>Anſ:</hi> By what authority the Author calleth that Scripture the Apoſtles <hi>Catechiſm,</hi> I underſtand not: there are principles and foundations named there, but that therefore it was the Apoſtles Catechiſm cannot be inſtructed: and that a form of <hi>ſound words</hi> ſhould have no more, or other words than theſe, cannot be made appear; and that which you call the Apoſtles Creed, differeth far from theſe words. 2.

                  <p>Page 83. <hi>But the most ſad and deplorable defect of your performance of this Duty, is your caſting out the reading of the Word of God from moſt of your publick Aſſemblies, directly contrary to Gods Inſtitution, and Ordinance, for the Inſtruction of his Church, inſomuch that ſetting aſide a verſe or two for a text or quotation at the diſcretion of the Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, the voyce of God is never publickly heard amongſt Them: this is a matter of Fact, and undeniable; and in all the Meetings of the North of</hi> Jreland <hi>in a whole Year, perhaps there is not ſo much Scripture read as in one day, in our Church, by the ſtricteſt enquiry I could make.</hi>
                  </p>

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:97381:44"/> that <hi>Preſbiterians belong not to the Catholick Church.</hi> The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of this maketh the Author's aſperſions the more eaſie, but I would willingly know from the Author's mature thoughts, what anſwer himſelf thinketh ſhould be given to ſuch Words, would he have us to belie our ſelves, and take with it; or will he take it patiently if we ſay it's falſe? for he may as warrantably ſay that we have no Aſſemblies, as that we have caſt the Word of God out of them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In this alſo we appeal to thouſands, who for many years have been ear witneſſes to the contrary.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Its ordinary for Miniſters of our Communion to Lecture on the Lords day before they preach, and many of them to my certain knowledge, read either a whole Chapter, or a Pſalm; ſome others if a Chapter be long, or have textual difficulties, will divide a Chapter, as they think fit for publick Edification.</p>
                  <p>We commonly every Lords-day ſing the Words of God three or four times, and ordinarly twice the number of verſes, that the Author nameth at each time.</p>
                  <p>Beſides our text, we quote and explain many Scriptures in our Sermons, and for this we are condemned by ſome of another Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, who I can inſtruct have ſaid, you may know men have little matter to Preach, when they quote many Scriptures; and on that very account have diſreliſhed our preaching: Tho many Scriptures, eſpecially when they are explained, are the very ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news of Preaching, and one of the Proper means for convincing the Conſciences of hearers, as the Apoſtles Sermons do teſtifie, which we find every where fortified with Scriptures, tho they had the immediat aſſiſtance of God's Spirit. I ſay not much at this time of other mens Sermons, how often they are deſtitute of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture evidence, and the loſs that hearers thereby ſuſtain.</p>
                  <p>But now let the candid Reader judge, having laid before him the many ways, we read and improve Scriptures in our publick Aſſemblies; and that by the mercy of God, we have now many Meeting-Houſes in the North of <hi>Ireland;</hi> and compare this with what the Author hath ſaid, <hi>That in all the Meetings of the North
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:97381:45"/> of</hi> Ireland <hi>in a whole year, perhaps there is not ſo much Scripture read as in one day in our Church,</hi> I am peſwaded that every thinking, and ingenuous perſon, of the Author's own perſwaſion, will be ſurpriſed at theſe words! Nay I can warrantably ſay, that often in one of our meeting Houſes, on the Lords day; there is as much Scripture firſt read by it ſelf in a <hi>Lecture,</hi> then <hi>ſinging</hi> with the words of <hi>David</hi> in Pſalms, then <hi>many quotations</hi> with explanation, that altogether will, I ſay frequently amount to as much as the four Chapters mentioned by the Author: And how his four Chapters will hold up, with above fourty meeting Houſes more; let any man of common ſenſe judge.</p>
                  <p>But the Author alledgeth our practice is contrary to Gods Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, becauſe as he ſaith, we make uſe but of a <hi>verſe</hi> or two for a Text.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> If we did <hi>caſt the word of God out of our Aſſemblies,</hi> as he ſaith, then our practice were contrary to the Inſtitution, no doubt.</p>
                  <p>But ſeing the Author mentioneth <hi>Inſtitution,</hi> and thereupon immediatly chargeth us, with reading too little in publick, and thereby guilty of neglecting the Inſtitution: this giveth me oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion again to require the Author's <hi>ſhewing</hi> of that Inſtitution, <hi>how much</hi> to read at once, or on one day: I ſhall never diſpute more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, or any man on that Head; if this Inſtitution can be made appear, where ſhall we find it?</p>
                  <p>Shall <hi>this Inſtitution</hi> for <hi>how much reading,</hi> be gathered from that which <hi>Moſes</hi> requireth, <hi>Deut.</hi> 31: 10. Which the Author quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth? but this was requird to be done, at their Feaſts of Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles, one of the <hi>Jews</hi> extraordinary Solemnities, <hi>2ly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> If the whole Law was then read <hi>is this the Inſtitution to read the whole Law at once?</hi> I believe the Author will make leſs reading ſerve him for one day: ſo then he findeth not our Inſtitution from this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>Is it from <hi>Joſhua's</hi> practice? but <hi>Joſhua's</hi> reading the whole Law together, will be found too great meaſure alſo.</p>
                  <p>Shall we have this Inſtitution from <hi>Ezra's</hi> practice, at that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary time, <hi>Neh.</hi> 8. 3. Where <hi>Ezra</hi> read from morning
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:97381:45"/> until mid-day, but this will be thought an extraordinary time the people not having ſeen the Law for a long time before, and therefore not a rule for ordinary Aſſemblies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>2ly.</hi> When the Law was then read, expounding attended the reading, and therefore is was not the <hi>meer pure reading only,</hi> which the Author ſeeketh after.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>3ly.</hi> If any ſhould ſuppoſe their reading ſo long, to be a precedent or rule for others to read as long, and ſo begin and practiſe it: yet according to the Author, no Copy can come ſo near the Original as his way, who appointeth four Chapters: ſo the Inſtitution for how much reading cannot be had here.</p>
                  <p>But may we have it from the practice of reading in the <hi>Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues?</hi> no, for if we had an account how much they read, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny would queſtion if their practice, could found an Inſtitution to us.</p>
                  <p>Where then ſhall we find <hi>this Institution?</hi> may we not warrantably, when we are looking every where for it; take into conſideration <hi>Chriſt's practice in reading?</hi> Luk. 4. Who, ſo far as is recorded to us, read but a few <hi>verſes</hi> of a <hi>Chap.</hi> and then cloſed the Book.</p>
                  <p>Shall we conſider the practice of his Apoſtles? but there we ſhall find much <hi>Preaching</hi> but <hi>little or no reading,</hi> performed by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in publick Aſſemblies.</p>
                  <p>Let not the reader miſtake, as if I were pleading either for little or no reading in publick Aſſemblies, but am only in purſuit of that Inſtitution mentioned by the Author, whereupon he foundeth his challenge, that we read too little Scripture: tho' it was his work to have diſcovered this <hi>Institution,</hi> before he had charged others with guilt for breach of it.</p>
                  <p>Seing then that it doth not appear, either by expreſs Scripture or neceſſary conſequence, that there is any particular <hi>Institution of God,</hi> oblidging Miniſters to read <hi>ſo much or ſo little at one time in</hi> publick Aſſemblies; then no men have power <hi>to preſcribe</hi> where God hath not preſcribed; having no Commiſſion for it: and ſeing they have no power to preſcribe, then they have no power to judge, and condemn for not following their dictates.</p>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:97381:46"/>
                  <p>Yet God hath not left us deſtitute of general rules; whereby our practice may be ſafely determined 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14 26. Let all things be done <hi>to edifying:</hi> this direction is given by the Apoſtle, for the due ordering of the ſeveral parts of the worſhip of God, when they came together in their Aſſemblies; that they ſhould have this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral rule before all their eyes, <hi>viz.</hi> The edification of the hearers, ſome of them thought the time of their worſhip ſhould be ſpent in one part of religious work, and ſome in another; but the Apoſtle requires to let all <hi>center</hi> in this of publick <hi>Edification.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This general rule was given to ſuch as were called of God, and fitted to Officiate, and ſpeak in Chriſtian Aſſemblies, the greateſt, or moſt eminent of them, had no Authority but for edification 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 8. The authority given the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was for no more.</p>
                  <p>Seing then that the Miniſters of Chriſt are to do all in his Service for edification: then this is to be their great Study; that by Chriſts direction, they may manage all the parts of his Worſhip, in ſuch Seaſon and Order, as may be fitteſt for the edification of his people: and to make this the more evident; it ſhould be conſidered, that Chriſt hath appointed his Miniſters to <hi>feed his flock;</hi> and as Stewards of the Myſteries of God, to give his people their <hi>portion</hi> in due Seaſon, as thoſe who muſt give an account to their Maſter; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to theſe Stewards it belongeth, by their Maſters direction to diſtribute the portion, and <hi>proportion,</hi> of food fit for them: and conſequently the time to be ſpent in <hi>reading, Preaching,</hi> and <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <hi>One would think this alone were ſufficient, to ſhew the people where the worſhip of God is in it's purity, and to prove our Aſſemblies to be the true Church of God; againſt all that come in competition with us.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>2ly.</hi> If this new opinion of the Author would paſs through the world as <hi>an Oracle;</hi> that every Church who <hi>read much</hi> Scriptures is a <hi>pure Church,</hi> then how eaſie were it for the moſt degenerate, Apoſttate Church in the world, for retriving the reputation of Purity; to appoint much Scripture to be read, I doubt not, but upon condition, that all the reformed Churches, would eſteem the Apoſtate Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> a pure Church; and conſequently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to her again, ſhe would ſoon appoint Scriptures to be read in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance, for by the Author's <hi>argument,</hi> this of <hi>reading much</hi> would <hi>prove her pure,</hi> what ever abominations, ſhe were ſunk in otherwayes.</p>

                  <p>For the <hi>2d</hi> pretence, <hi>Page 89. That copies of the Bible are now common and eaſie to be had, and moſt Families, have ſome in them that can read.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>Anſ:</hi> We have great reaſon to give thanks to God that it is ſo, and the greater fault it is to neglect reading of Scriptures in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, ſeing God hath dealt ſo bountifully with us.</p>

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:97381:47"/> the Bible privatly, is to leave Gods way, and preſumptuouſly depend on that, which has no promiſe annexed to it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ:</hi> If privat reading of the Scriptures have <hi>no promiſe</hi> annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to it; then <hi>what profit</hi> is it for any man to read the Scripture? if no bleſſing be promiſed, his labour is loſt: if I had not read this expreſſion in the Author's Book, it would been hard believing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny report, that ſuch <hi>dangerous, unwarrantable</hi> words, could have dropt from his Pen.</p>
                  <p>2ly, God hath commanded privat reading of the Scriptures, as <hi>expreſly,</hi> as he hath commanded <hi>publick reading:</hi> whereby it becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the <hi>Ordinance</hi> of God, no leſs than publick reading, let the Reader obſerve what God ſpeaketh, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. from <hi>verſe</hi> 6. and downward, <hi>The Laws of God were to be written, on the very poſts of their houſes, that they might read them frequently.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3ly, Seing then this privat reading of the Word of God is his Ordinance, no leſs than publick reading; by what warrand can the Author ſay, there is no promiſe annexed to it: But beſides this,</p>
                  <p>4ly, <hi>I</hi> will prove from the Word of God that promiſes are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed, to the People of God's privat Diligence, in reading the Scriptures, Let the Reader obſerve <hi>Deut, 6. verſe</hi> 3, where we have theſe words, <hi>Hear therefore, O Iſrael, and obſerve to do it, that it may be well with thee, and that ye may increaſe mightily, as the Lord God of thy fathers hath promiſed thee, in the Land that floweth with milk and honey.</hi> Here is a comprehenſive promiſe, containing many bleſſings; <hi>That it may be well with thee:</hi> and next, the qualifications of the perſons to whom this Promiſe belongeth, followeth <hi>verſe 5. Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart.</hi> Verſe 6. and <hi>theſe words which I command thee this day, ſhall be in thine heart:</hi> and verſe 7. <hi>And thou ſhalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and ſhalt talk of them when thou ſitteſt in thine houſe.</hi> And verſe 9 <hi>Thou ſhalt write them upon the poſts of thine houſe, and one thy gates.</hi> By which Scripture its evident, that ſuch as diligently make uſe of the Word of God in their Houſes, have the <hi>promiſe of God,</hi> that <hi>it ſhall be well with them.</hi> Let the Author find out a more <hi>expreſs</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:97381:48"/> made to <hi>publick reading,</hi> than is here to <hi>privat reading,</hi> then its no preſumption to depend on this promiſe, annexed to privat reading.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ibid: There are ſtill many families even amongſt Proteſtants, that can neither compaſs a Bible, or get any to read it.</hi>

                     <hi>Anſ:</hi> Bleſſed be God, that even poor people among us, will pinch themſelves, rather than want a Bible, and ſuch as are ſo very poor that they cannot procure one, it were charity in the Author, who is able, to provide ſome Bibles for ſuch indigent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; As for theſe who cannot read, where God giveth a heart for it, they take help of their Neighbours who can read.</p>
                  <p>2. The Author injuriouſly ſuppoſeth them, to be <hi>deprived</hi> of all publick reading of the Word of God, which <hi>I</hi> have proved al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready to be an unjuſt imputation; <hi>ibid: (and there are at this day too many of all parties, that neither read themſelves, nor hear one Chapter read, in a whole year, except at Church</hi>

                  <p>Page 92. The Author ſaith <hi>That the word of God cannot be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to have the ſame efficacy when read privatly, as it hath when read in the Aſſemblies of Chriſtians: ſince he has given us a peculiar pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to be preſent in ſuch Aſſemblies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ:</hi> The promiſe of this peculiar <hi>preſence,</hi> is <hi>Matth. 18. 20. Where two or three are met together in my name,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <p>Page 92. <hi>The third pretence alledged is, that reading takes up too much time, and is a hinderance to the more profitable Duty, of what you commonly call preaching.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ:</hi> Its tedious to be always put to declare, that not one of theſe pretences are ours.</p>
                  <p>The Author may debate againſt himſelf if he will; yet</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Page</hi> 93. The Author giveth a new Conceſſion, which is in my opinion too ample, and more than we deſire, or reſolve to practiſe, when he ſaith, <hi>Suppoſe that upon ſome extraordinary occaſion it may be lawful to omit reading of Gods Word in our Aſſemblies, that we may have the more time to manage a Diſcourſe for the instruction, of the people.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ:</hi> If there be time to manage a Diſcourſe, <hi>I</hi> do not think it lawful altogether, to omit reading of the Word of God, in a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Chriſtian Aſſembly, conveened for the Worſhip of God; for we are to expect the Aſſembly <hi>ſanctified by the Word</hi> and Prayer, to paſs from <hi>much</hi> reading, to <hi>no</hi> reading, is too great haſte.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Page</hi> 94. His fourth pretence is, <hi>That the Scriptures are hard to be underſtood, or applyed, and therefore only ſo much of them ought to be read at a time, as the Minister may apply to his Auditory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Albeit this pretence or Objection, hath more to ſay for it ſelf than the reſt.</p>
                  <p>Yet we pretend to no manner of Reaſon againſt publick read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ſeing its both our principle and practice; therefore its not candide to repreſent us to the World, as enemies to it, and diſput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt our common practice.</p>
                  <p>2ly, To Explain Scripture to the people, we judge neceſſary, and the very way of God fitted for Edification: practiſed by our Saviour himſelf, the Levites, the Prophets, and the Apoſtles, and to repreſent us as Expounding, or applying only a Verſe, is not fair, that being <hi>your own way, not ours,</hi> to explain but <hi>a verſe</hi> or two on the Lords Day; it being common with us to expound <hi>ten times</hi> more Scripture <hi>every Lords Day</hi> than you do, conceiving it a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mean diſcharge of a Miniſters duty only to read, and ſo have done, and never found to be the way of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or any of his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, whoſe work in publick was always to Expound, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:97381:49"/> Scripture; and therefore our way in publick Goſpel admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations, is more agreeable to <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Apoſtles way than yours.</p>
                  <p>Page 94. <hi>Its the opinion of the Reformed Churches, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are plain in all things neceſſary to Salvation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ:</hi> And yet its the general opinion of the Reformed Churches, that Scripture ſhould be Expounded to the people.</p>
                  <p>2ly, Though God in his mercy hath made the Eſſentials of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity plain; yet nevertheleſs the Apoſtle made it his care, to <hi>make known the whole counſel of God;</hi> we are obliged to make full proof of our Miniſtry, in helping the people to know their whole duty to God, revealed in the Scripture.</p>
                  <p>3ly, If this argument of the author hath any ſtrength, it mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tateth againſt all Miniſterial Inſtructions; and that no more is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, but read the Foundamentals of the Chriſtian Religion to the people, and ſo have done.</p>
                  <p>4ly, Do not ſome wreſt the Scriptures to their own deſtruction? and whoſe duty is it ſo much as Miniſters, to prevent this danger by explaining theſe things that are hard to be underſtood?</p>
                  <p>But the Author ſtill appears out of Charity, with this Explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and applying; for</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ibid: The holy Scriptures when heard with humility, and attention, apply themſelves better than any man can do.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ:</hi> If it were as the Author ſaith, then there is little uſe for a Miniſtry in the World, and at moſt a <hi>reading miniſtry</hi> might do all; let them but read well, and the Scriptures will <hi>apply themſelves:</hi> the Chriſtian World then is but cheated, to be at ſo vaſt a charge, for maintaining Miniſters <hi>only to read.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2ly, To ſay that Scriptures <hi>apply themſelves</hi> without any adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titous help, or aſſiſtance, is not ſound, the Author ſhould leave place at leaſt for the <hi>help of the Spirit of God;</hi> without which, Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture will never apply themſelves.</p>
                  <p>3ly, The Author here diſputeth againſt the very Examples, that <hi>Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> and his Apoſtles hath given us, in applying of Scriptures: not being of his mind, that the Scriptures would apply themſelves.</p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:97381:49"/>
                  <p>4ly, If the Scriptures apply themſelves, How was it then that the Diſciples of <hi>Chriſt</hi> (who cannot be ſaid to want humility, and attention, and had often heard the Scripture) yet continued, ſo ſlow either to underſtand, or believe the Scriptures? they could never find the Scriptures applying themſelves, until <hi>Chriſt</hi> opened the eyes of their underſtanding.</p>
                  <p>Page 95. <hi>It ought therefore to be our firſt care to read them to the people often, and ſolemnly; that they may be acquainted with the whole body of them; and then one word of Application may do more good than many Sermons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ:</hi> Beſides all the Scriptures that we ſolemnly read, and make uſe of in our publick Aſſemblies, wherein we are <hi>not behind</hi> with our neighbours; I ſay beſides, its our care to exhort our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to diligence in reading Scriptures <hi>in privat,</hi> for the increaſe of Scripture knowledge; the performance whereof, they find to be bleſſed of God, according to his promiſe. Wiſhing our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours were more exhorted to the ſame duty; this ſerveth alſo to refel the Calumny inſinuated in the Authors following words; ſaying, <hi>That our not reading looketh like a deſign on the people, and is agreeable to the artifices of Romiſh Prieſts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Suggeſtion is irrational, to ſay that Miniſters are on a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of concealing Scriptures, who exhort, beſeech, and obteſt the people to diligence in reading them, in ſo much that its cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurable amongſt us, if there be a known, and common neglecter of this duty, I wiſh theſe words, <hi>Pſal:</hi> 15. 3. be dayly conſidered.</p>
                  <p>What the Author <hi>Pages</hi> 96, 97 and 98 delivereth, requireth no anſwer, containing no new Argument: and for calling <hi>the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures a dead letter,</hi> we abhor it, tho the Author makes it the fifth pretence againſt reading.</p>
                  <p>Page 99. The pretence is, <hi>That a Child may read the Scriptures, and ſo perform this Duty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ:</hi> Neither do we make this a pretence againſt publick read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for tho it be true upon the matter, that a Child may read; yet we know that reading the Word of God in publick Chriſtian Aſſemblies, belongeth to the Miniſters of the Goſpel, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:97381:50"/> we practiſe, and employ no Children for that Work.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Page</hi> 100. The Author giveth inſtance of an advice in our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory, <hi>To read over all the Canonical Books of Scripture in order.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ:</hi> Let the Reader obſerve, that there's no <hi>Apocripha</hi> to be read by this Advice.</p>
                  <p>2ly, That they directed no Canonical Scripture to be <hi>leſt</hi> out of publick Goſpel adminiſtrations, ſo that they were on no deſign to conceal Scriptures from the people.</p>
                  <p>3ly, I know where this of reading the Scriptures in order, was not only deſigned, but begun by ſome of our number, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable progreſs made: but Perſecution driving them from pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick work; and the people of our perſwaſion under great ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, their Miniſters were conſtrained to ſelect ſuch Scriptures, as were moſt appoſit for inſtructing, exhorting, and comforting an afflicted people.</p>
                  <p>All that I find further to the end of this Chapter, beareth no argument, but are meer groundleſs Invectives: and I ſhall only ſay, that if I found my ſelf ſo keen for much publick reading, and inclined to diſcourage privat reading of the Word of God, I could not but ſuſpect my ſelf to be acted by a <hi>Phariſaical</hi> Spirit.</p>

                  <head>SECT. 1.</head>
                  <p>I Find a great Defect in all the Authors Diſcourſe, by his not ſtating the queſtion, betwixt Diſſenters and him, upon any of the Heads he Treateth, which method requireth to be firſt done; that ſo the Reader might know diſtinctly, what is maintained by the Author, and what is denyed by Diſſenters; but he abruptly ingageth in Probations, before his Reader can know what it is that muſt be proved: whereby its impoſſible for him ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally or convincingly to place a Cenſure; as for inſtance, in this ſame Chapter he beginneth off hand with his Proofs of Bodily Worſhip; which Diſſenters deny not; and ſo goeth on, impoſing on his Reader, as if we were all ſtated Enemies to Bodily Adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: which is an injuſt Imputation.</p>
                  <p>2ly, The Authors ſtating of Bodily Worſhip as <hi>bodily</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out internal Adoration, as one of the diſtinct grand parts of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip by its ſelf, is not ſafe; becauſe Bodily Worſhip ſeparated from internal adoration, can be no acceptable Worſhip to God: which is the rather to be adverted, becauſe in the following Diſcourſe, it will appear, that the Author will have it Worſhip, yea accepted Worſhip; where not only there was a privation and want, of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward homage, but a fixt hatred of the Object externally wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiped.</p>
                  <p>Before I proceed to examine the Authors Arguments, it will not be amiſs to take notice of his Conceſſion on this Head, <hi>Page</hi> 133. ſaying, <hi>But that in whatſoever place, or whatever time, in whatſoever poſture, we offer up our Spirits and hearts to God, we are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of him.</hi> This muſt be whether we pray ſitting, lying, ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:97381:51"/> or kneeling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This breaketh the bones of all his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: ſeing praying with grace in the heart will be acceptable to God in any poſture.</p>
                  <p>All the Author hath on this firſt Section until <hi>Page</hi> 106. are probations for bodily worſhip, or external Adoration, and the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures quoted, we accept without diſpute, knowing we ſhould glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God in body, and Spirit, according to his command.</p>
                  <p>But here he beginneth a retreat from his conceſſion, as too ample: and to ſay truth, it was too large, being ſo ill cautioned, his words now are; <hi>It being a contempt of God, and contrary to his Commands, to pray to him for inſtance without ſome poſture of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration, when we can do it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is an unwarrantable cenſure, beſides it's being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory to his Conceſſion, for <hi>Elijah,</hi> ſo far as we can underſtand by his circumſtances, might have chooſed another poſture, when he ſat, and ſpake to God, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19. 6. whom we cannot charge with contempt of God, being a Prophet ſo zealous for his glory.</p>
                  <p>When our Saviour gave the miracle of feeding ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, with a few loaves, <hi>Matth. 14. 19. he commanded</hi> the people to <hi>ſit down</hi> on the graſs; and looking up to Heaven, he bleſſed, and brake, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Here was ſitting at moſt Divine and Solemn wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and yet no contempt on the peoples part, for they were <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to ſit down.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Godly men who are acquainted with continual reſorting into God, and making their requeſts known to him in every thing, praying alwayes: may often in a day, yea, poſſibly in one hour direct their prayers unto God. The Artificer in his Shop, the Merchant in a publick Exchange, the Souldier at his Poſt: may find it neceſſary to ſend from their hearts many ejaculatory prayers in the poſture they are in, without contempt of God, tho' they could alter their poſture, knowing they might have moe than one of theſe ſhort uſual prayers, before they could get the poſture of their bodies altered, and fitted for external adoration: ſo that the Author ſhould have better cautioned his cenſures.</p>

                     <hi>Page</hi> 107. 108. Are only proofs that bodily worſhip is due, and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:97381:51"/> therefore no anſwer neceſſary, ſeing we are as much for it as the Author, in the ſeaſon God requireth it: but in this laſt <hi>Page he giveth inſtance of bodily worſhip from devils, our Saviour looked on this bodily worſhip to be ſo indiſpenſably his due, that he accepted of it from the very Devils;</hi> Mark 3. 11. <hi>And unclean ſpirits when they ſaw him, fell down before him, and cried, thou art the ſon of God.</hi>

                  <p>

Chriſt came to deſtroy their works; this ſhould the rather be obſerved, becauſe of what the Author ſayeth, <hi>Page 110th. But bending, or bowing of the body, is that, which is properly in Scripture called worſhip, as ſignifying immediatly, and naturally, the bending and ſubmiſſion of our Souls, and nothing elſe.</hi> How the external worſhiping of Devils, will na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally ſignifie the ſubmiſſion of the minds in Devils who hate Chriſt and his Dominion; let the Author ſee to it; I ſhall have occaſion for farther Reflection on this hereafter; and ſo paſs it now; and that our Saviour accepted their ſervice is againſt the Text; for he rejected it, not liking ſuch preachers; withal it's moſt probable theſe Devils deſigned a publick affront to our Saviour, in giving him a teſtimony, as his friends, that ſo Chriſts malicious enemies, might have their blaſphemy fortified, that he did caſt out Devils by the prince of Devils, as followeth in the ſame <hi>Chap. verſe 22. by the prince,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                     <hi>Anſ:</hi> Here the ground of the Quarrel, that we bow not when we enter the Church, yielding ſome religious ſign of Reverence; or rather that we do not religiouſly bow to the Church, as ſhall be made appear; the foundation that he layeth for this inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is <hi>Matth. 18. 21.

This Promiſe is made to ſuch as are gathered <hi>in his name,</hi> that is at his command, for his ſervice, and worſhip, with dependence upon him. 3.

The promiſe is made to the very <hi>feweſt</hi> that can meet together, on the foreſaid account.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve, That external Adoration is due two ways; 1. When we approach God in immediat acts of Worſhip, as Prayer, and Praiſes. 2. When it pleaſeth God in an extraordinary manner to appear in his Glory, the due ſeaſon then, for external ſigns of inward homage and reverence is, when we perform theſe immediat acts of Worſhip in our Aſſemblies; or if God ſhall pleaſe, to give glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſigns of his extraordinary preſence, as he did to <hi>Moſes,</hi> when the Bush was burning but not conſumed; or as the Lord appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, after <hi>Solomon</hi> had made an end of Praying, when the fire came down from Heaven, and the Glory of the Lord filled the houſe; then all the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> beholding the fire and glory of the Lord, bowed themſelves and worſhipped, whenſoever the Lord doth thus appear, external adoration is due.</p>
                  <p>But it cannot be ſaid, that the Lords ordinary preſence, with his people, requireth this bodily reverence; for there is a peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar preſence of <hi>Chriſt</hi> promiſed to the Miniſters of the Goſpel, who bear his Commiſſion; <hi>Lo I am with you to the end of the world;</hi> yet
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:97381:53"/> this doth not oblige them always, <hi>ad ſemper,</hi> to external acts of adoration, otherways they ſhould be alwayes in theſe acts, he being always with them; So there is a peculiar pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that Chriſt will make his abode with Believers, <hi>Joh. 14. 23. And we will make our abode with him,</hi> this is alſo a peculiar pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of his preſence, for its appropriated unto ſound believers, who love him, and keep his words, yet this doth not oblige unto a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant bodily worſhip.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve alſo, That this promiſe is made to the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> gathered together, but not to the <hi>place</hi> where they aſſemble: How is it then, that religious reverence is payed to the Houſe, Church, or Fabrick, before the aſſembly be gathered; for if there were but one in the Church, he who cometh in, muſt perform ſome religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous external reverence; yea, if there be none in the Houſe, he who cometh firſt in, muſt do the like, otherwiſe he is a Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour, and guilty of profane contempt; yea, if a man enter that Houſe, upon any other occaſion, when no publick Worſhip is to be performed, yet he muſt do the like, which doth undenyably prove, that its not <hi>Chriſts preſence,</hi> but the <hi>houſe</hi> that's honoured, with this religious reverence, which will yet further appear, if it be conſidered, that if a few perſons meet together to ask any thing of God, and for his Worſhip, the promiſed preſence of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is there, no leſs than in the publick Church; yet religious reverence is not teſtified by any external ſign, in that privat place, as in the other; therefore this religious honour is not rendered to <hi>Chriſt</hi> as preſent in the aſſemblies of his people, but to the Altar or Fabrick of the Houſe, and this being religious Worſhip, let the Author conſider, how this practice can be reconciled to the ſecond Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>

                  <p>Page 125. <hi>But 4ly. The full anſwer to the argument is, that it goes on a falſe ſuppoſition, that our Saviour instituted this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in the common poſture of eating, which no wiſe appears in Scripture neither can it be inferred from any thing ſaid, or intimated by the Evangeliſts or St.</hi> Paul, <hi>but rather the contrary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> How full or ſound it is, will ſoon appear if we conſider, <hi>Firſt,</hi> that the Evangeliſt <hi>Matthew</hi> remarketh their ſitting down, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 20. Now when the even was come, he ſat down, with
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:97381:58"/> the twelve, and <hi>Verſe 16. as they were eating, Jeſus took bread, and bleſſed it,</hi> &amp;c. ſo mark 14. 18. <hi>and as they ſat, and did eat, Jeſus ſaid, verily I ſay unto you, one of you which eateth with me, ſhall betray me:</hi> and Verſe 22. <hi>and as they did eat, Jeſus took bread, and bleſſed and brake it,</hi> ſo Luk. 22. 14. <hi>and when the hour was come, he ſat down, and the twelve apoſtles with him, and</hi> Verſe 19. <hi>and he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, ſo</hi> Joh. 13. 12. <hi>after he had waſhed their feet, and had taken his garments and was ſet down again,</hi> after this the apoſtles are ſitting with him at Table, <hi>Verſe 23. Now there was leaning on Jeſus boſome, on of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Here it's to be obſerved, that all the four Evangeliſts make mention of their ſitting at Table with Chriſt, and that it's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſaid by two of them, as they did eat, he took bread, and bleſſed it; all which maketh it moſt evident, that they were in a ſitting poſture at Table, when this Sacrament was inſtituted, and celebrated.</p>
                  <p>But the Author objecteth, <hi>how could they be eating, when Chriſt was bleſſing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> The plain words of the Text cannot be queſtioned, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a profane contempt of Scripture, it's not warrantable then to toſs It as a diſputable problem, whether he <hi>took bread as they did, eat, or not:</hi> for they are the words of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>2ly,</hi> Nor is it to be conceived, that they continued eating, while he was bleſſing, this would been altogether unaccountable.</p>

                     <hi>3ly.</hi> Tho' not eating, yet they continued ſitting in a Table poſture, for we muſt not add to the Text, and ſay they aroſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>4ly.</hi> How much time interveen'd between his taking the bread, and bleſſing, who can tell? the enſuing Action being ſo ſolemn, no doubt Chriſt would take care, to have his diſciples minds in ſome due compoſure for it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>5ly.</hi> That which the Author cannot digeſt, is that the Apoſtles ſhould be ſitting, when Chriſt was bleſſing; but there is no cauſe why this ſhould be ſo ſurprizing, if ſome other of our Saviours ptactices be duely pondered: as <hi>Mat.</hi> 14. 19. when there is a great miracle to be wrought, Chriſt <hi>commandeth</hi> the multitude to
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:97381:59"/> 
                     <hi>ſit down</hi> and then bleſſeth, <hi>and he commanded the multitude to ſit down on the graſs, and took the five loaves, and the two fiſhes, and looking up to Heaven, he bleſſed, and brake,</hi> and this not once, but again <hi>Mat. 15. 35. And he</hi> Commanded <hi>the multitude to ſit down on the ground, and he took the ſeven loaves, and the fiſhes, and</hi> gave thanks <hi>and brake,</hi> &amp;c. In both theſe ſcriptures there is moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn worſhip, and yet the people commanded to ſit down; it were worſe than trifling, to ſay they might riſe again when Chriſt gave thanks, ſeing he commanded them to ſit down: therefore the Author's anxitie for this is groundleſs, and no uſe for ſuch ſhifts, as <hi>in probabilitie it was done in a thankſgiving and praying po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture.</hi> And as in the next <hi>Page 126. And ſo he might riſe to bleſs, and diſtribute the Holy Sacrament;</hi> Theſe <hi>may be's</hi> are not convincing, but the plain words of ſo many Texts for ſitting, are moſt <hi>cogent</hi> and irrefragable.</p>
                  <p>Page 126. <hi>Laſtly we find the Apoſtle, ſeverly reproving the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians, for their irreverence in receiving this Sacrament,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>This alſo hath been confuted already, and all that is ſaid <hi>Page</hi> 130. For the time of Thankſgiving before Receving, being ſolemn Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, our people generally ſtand, excepting ſuch as are ſet down at Table, who continue ſitting, <hi>as at the firſt giving of Thanks</hi> by our Saviour, they did ſit. But the Author in this Page 130, enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth himſelf, in another uſeleſs labour of Collecting pretences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Bodily Worſhip, and expoſing of Diſſenters, as formers of theſe pretences, which we ſolemnly deteſt, as contrary to our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon practice, ſuch Diſcourſe might have been directed to Atheiſts, and Quakers, but to impreſs ſtrangers ſo invidiouſly, againſt all proteſtant Diſſenters, as enemies to the Adoration of God, by any viſible ſign, is moſt injurious.</p>
                  <p>2ly, In all the following Diſcourſe to the end of this Chapter, the Reader is egregiouſly impoſed on, the Author making no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction between the Bodily Worſhip commanded <hi>of God,</hi> and the Bodily Worſhip commanded <hi>only by men;</hi> and ſo condemneth all, as deſpiſers of the Glory of God, who will not bow down to Houſes or Altars, and would have his Reader take it for granted, that its our principle, to be againſt all external Adoration of God, for no other reaſon, but becauſe we obſerve the ſecond Command, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than ſome of our Neighbours, rendring that homage to Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which is only due to God, wherein we cannot, and by the grace of God will not comply with them.</p>
                  <p>Pages 130, 131, 132, 133, 134; Have nothing but a Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of pretences from <hi>Joh: 4. 24. God is a Spirit, and they that Worſhip him, must worſhip him in Spirit, and truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ: Chriſt</hi> by this Scripture, doth recommend and prefer Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Worſhip, to that which is only bodily, God being a Spirit, and all bodily worſhip ſeparat from this is naught; the external part is eaſie, and ſeparable from the internal, and of it ſelf, is but bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily exerciſe, that profiteth little; nevertheleſs we conſtantly aſſert it our duty to glorifie God in Body and in Spirit, as he requireth us; and therefore are far from underſtanding that Scripture, to be excluſive of external Adoration.</p>

                  <p>Page 135. The ſecond pretence alledged againſt bodily adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is that <hi>God has no value for it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ:</hi> If ever the Author heard any ſuch Objection againſt exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal homage from any of our perſwaſion, it would be juſtice, and we would take it for kindneſs, if he would diſcover them; and if no ſuch perſon can be found amongſt us, it will be neceſſary to mind the Words of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15. 3. It ſufficeth us that God hath commanded external worſhip; but we will yield Gods Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to no man in preſcribing it.</p>
                  <p>Page 173. The Author ſpeaking of outward performances, ſaith, <hi>But you are taught, that in no caſes, they may be lawfully practiſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ:</hi> Who are theſe Teachers, Teaching that outward Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, may in no caſes be practiſed? The Book being now in my hand, I ſee on the head of the Page, how Bodily Worſhip is practiſed by Diſſenters. And is it the deliberat thoughts of the Author, that Diſſenting Teachers, Teach this? Do we teach, that in no caſes, the people may read, or hear the Word of God read, which is an outward performance? Do we teach that they ſhould not be Baptized, or partake of the Lords Supper? Do we teach, that in no caſe they ſhould bow their knees to God their Maker? all theſe, and many moe, are outward performances, this needeth no confutation, repeating the words will be ſufficient to any read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, tho of mean ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>The Author addeth in the ſame Page, <hi>you are taught rather to ſtay at home, and not to worſhip God at all publickly, than to conform in their outward geſtures and circumſtances.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ:</hi> There are ſome bodily jeſtures that render a man guilty by breach of the ſecond Command, as bodily bowing is a geſture of the body, but being performed religiouſly, to any Creature, is forbidden by the expreſs Command of God, and therefore ſhould not be enrolled with Circumſtances, nor is it to be practiſed by Chriſtians any where; but God willing, more of this afterwards.</p>
                  <p>In the ſame Page 137, <hi>You are adviſed rather to abſtain all your lives from the Lords Supper, than receive it kneeling.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ:</hi> Bleſſed be God, who hath given moſt of us opportunity
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:97381:61"/> of <hi>receiving,</hi> ever ſince we were capable, <hi>without kneeling,</hi> even when perſecuted by the rigid impoſers of kneeling, who yet dare not <hi>aſſert, that the Scriptures require it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2ly, But that the Reader may underſtand, that its neither igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, obſtinacy, nor affected ſeparation, that cauſeth the fixed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our practice, in ſitting at the Lords Table, which we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reſile from, and being obliged to render a reaſon, to ſuch as ask; know therefore, firſt, That the bleſſed example of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Apoſtles, of choice, uſing this poſture of ſitting, is our Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Precedent, and no reaſon can be given why the example ſhould not be imitated; the Apoſtles were ſinful men as others; yet all the four Evangeliſts are divinely inſpired, and therefore comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to publiſh their being ſet down with <hi>Chriſt</hi> at his holy Table.</p>
                  <p>3ly, No other Scripture, either expreſly, or by due conſequence, preſcribeth or alloweth any other poſture, when we receive at the Lords Table, than <hi>ſitting.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4ly, Our Saviour and his Apoſtles (as they followed him) are propoſed as our examples in all things imitable, and this practice is imitable; yea <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf maketh this his Argument, <hi>Do as I have given you example,</hi> Joh: 13. 14. 15. <hi>v.</hi> Leſt any ſhould ſay, we are not Apoſtles, and muſt not preſume to ſit at Table as they did; But Chriſt requireth a regard to the Example he giveth.</p>
                  <p>5ly, The Diſciples being fet down at Table with Chriſt, are not raiſed again by him, when the Lords Supper is celebrated, (which he would have done, if ſitting, when they received, had been a profanation of that Ordinance) but when the Supper is over, they are found ſtill ſitting, and then, and not until then, they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to ariſe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 31.</p>
                  <p>6ly, If this example be not followed in receiving, as our pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern, then we ſhall follow either devices excogitated by our ſelves, or follow the Dictates and Commandments of others, neither of which are ſafe and warrantable, <hi>Christ</hi> having propoſed his imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table practice for our example, and the worſhip performed by our own invention, or the Commandments of Men, is already declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vain.</p>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:97381:61"/>
                  <p>7ly. When we once give way, loſing our ground by neglecting Chriſts example, we wander vainly after our own imaginations, not knowing where to fix; and if at length we ſhould pitch upon the moſt humble like way of receiving, imagining a humble way can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be diſpleaſing to God, which prevaileth with many inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, (tho ſober) perſons. The very thought of this, that they cannot be too humble, and that kneeling in receiving, is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of this humility, that humility is pleaſing to God, and rendereth glory to him; this taking root enclineth many to think, and tenaciouſly to hold by it, that tho Chriſt gave example for ſitting at his Table, yet this deviſed humble way, will expiat any guilt by neglect of his example; becauſe they intend to give him glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry by kneeling: This is the very beſt that I imagine, can be made of the practice of many well meaning people as to their kneeling in receiving. But that which ſhould be obſerved with care, is that once leaving Chriſts way, the very beſt and pureſt like Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our own, obtruded on God as Worſhip, will not be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſeing by them, we ſhall never be able to make anſwer, when we are charged, <hi>Who hath required this at your hands,</hi> we may call it <hi>humility,</hi> but he will call it a preſumptuous <hi>voluntary humility;</hi> we may call it <hi>Worſhip,</hi> but he will call it <hi>Will-worſhip,</hi> there being no Command of God for it.</p>
                  <p>8ly, This religious kneeling is Adoration, and therefore due on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to God.</p>
                  <p>9ly, We are inſtructed by the ſecond Command, that God will not be adored or worſhipped by Images, repreſentations, or the likeneſs of any thing in Heaven or Earth, we muſt not bow down before them.</p>
                  <p>10ly, The ſigns of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Body and Bloud are ſet before the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, in a religious ſtate, as repreſenting <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and theſe who kneel muſt do it directly before theſe Signs, as memorials of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> if they ſhould go aſide and kneel, praying to God, yet they ſhall not receive, until they come and kneel before theſe Signs; and hereby the Signs have Co-adoration with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> partaking of the ſame Worſhip, ſeing the ſigns are deſignedly ſet before the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:97381:62"/> in the act of Adoration, which is forbidden by the ſecond Command, neither can the intention of the Worſhipper, prevent it, ſeing the Worſhip is directed firſt to the ſigns, as repreſenting <hi>Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>11ly, Tho the Arguments given, be ſufficient to vindicat our practice in ſitting at the Lords Table; yet we know alſo, that kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Sacrament is but a novelty in the Church of God, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in practice, before the thirteenth Century, when Pope <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi> the 3d brought in Tranſubſtantiation, which engageth the <hi>Papiſts</hi> to this worſhip, becauſe of <hi>Chriſts</hi> ſuppoſed bodily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, but this you do not pretend.</p>
                  <p>Page 138. <hi>Your directory does not require or allow the people ſo much, as to ſignifie their aſſent, by adding an</hi> Amen <hi>to Prayer or Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving: but on the contrary, you ridicule thoſe that practiſe it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ:</hi> Our people ſignifie their aſſent by much more, than the word <hi>Amen,</hi> by attentive hearing the Word, and being unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, when the Word of God is read, by joyning with the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter in Prayer, and ſtanding up<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by ſinging of Pſalms joyntly together, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let the Authors Conceſſion, <hi>Page</hi> 36. be remembred, where he ſaith, <hi>Generally it is ſufficient that the people joyn in their hearts with the words of publick prayer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2ly, We commonly uſe the word <hi>Amen,</hi> in concluſion of our Prayers, wherein the people joyn in their hearts with the Miniſter, as well as in the reſt of the Prayer.</p>
                  <p>Yet 3ly, under the New Teſtament, its to be obſerved, that the prayers of the Apoſtles recorded, are not found to be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with <hi>Amen:</hi> But that which ſhould make all men ſober in their Cenſures on this account, is that the Lords Prayer according to the Evangeliſt <hi>Luke</hi> concludeth not with <hi>Amen,</hi> I am no ways againſt the uſe of it, and for ridiculing others, for uſing that word, I never heard, or knew any ſuch thing, they cannot be of our communion, who will deride a Miniſters concluding prayers with <hi>Amen;</hi> for we uſe it ordinarly both in publick and privat.</p>

                  <p>Page 140. The third pretence; <hi>Some alledge for their omitting, this part of Gods Worſhip, that they do not condemn bodily adoration, but to ſtand up, and kneel in the Congregation, is ſo troubleſom to them,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ:</hi> This alſo is anſwered before, its not unwillingneſs to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, but as I ſaid already, all in the Congregation could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently hear the prayer, wherewith they are to joyn, if conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency were prepared for every ones kneeling; and I have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſome in this congregation, who were near, kneeling in the time of publick prayer, having conveniency for it; but there is none with us to ridicule them for that practice, tho the Author ſaith, Page 143, <hi>That he could never learn; that any one kneeled in our Meetings;</hi> but I have learned it, and ſeen it, having better oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to know it than the Author, and he may by this time per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, it had been very adviſable, that in matters of Fact, his aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions had been ſuch, as might have faced the Sun.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>As to the frequency of Celebrating the Lords Supper, I find many peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of opinion, that the Scriptures have determined nothing in it, and that therefore it is left intirely to the diſcretion of Miniſters, how often they will Celebrat it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ:</hi> The Author writeth, <hi>Page</hi> 147. That himſelf is of the ſame mind, <hi>our Saviour has confined us to no place or prefixt time, for the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration of his Supper:</hi> The Scriptures conſtrain the Author to this Conceſſion; but being granted, it will break all the bones of his Arguments; for ſeing <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath not preſcribed the <hi>frequency,</hi> Then who may preſume to do it? Shall not their preſcriptions be found the Commandments of men? I do not ſay but the circumſtance of time muſt be appointed, <hi>when</hi> this Ordinance ſhall be put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, for it muſt be done in <hi>ſome time,</hi> and that time muſt be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined; for the Lords Supper requires preparation before receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and therefore a competent allowance of time muſt be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before the Celebration: but ſeing our Saviour hath not prefixed the times, nor told us <hi>how often</hi> we ſhall celebrat; therefore men cannot make general Rules, obliging all Chriſtians to ſuch or ſuch prefixed times, whether opportunities offer or not.</p>
                  <p>Becauſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath given his Churchs liberty as to the preciſe times; but particular Churches muſt conſider and conſult the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick edification of the people, and accordingly ſuch times muſt be
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:97381:63"/> appointed by theſe whom the Lord hath intruſted with the feeding of his flock, and giving them their meat in due ſeaſon.</p>
                  <p>Page 146, <hi>On this account every one is left to judge for himſelf, when he will be a partaker of it, as he thinks it moſt fit for his comfort and edification, which makes the celebration and receiving it ſo Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary a thing, that many never receive it at all: and the Univerſal neglect of it is, become one of the crying ſins of theſe Kingdoms; and a great objection againſt the Reformation.</hi>

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> A judgment of diſcretion muſt be allowed all men whom God hath endued with Reaſon: and muſt not be driven to Act brutally without diſcretion; but eſpecially Chriſtians are required to Act in receiving of the Lords Supper, with the greateſt diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and deliberation, being under that ſevere warning, <hi>he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himſelf; and is guilty of the Body and blood of the Lord.</hi> A Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian thus warned, muſt be perſwaded in his own mind, and dare not truſt his preparation to the diſcretion of others, knowing he muſt give an account to God for himſelf.</p>

                     <hi>Anſ,</hi> Where contempt of the Sacrament is the cauſe of not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, no doubt but the ſin is very crying; but where there is no <hi>contempt,</hi> or wilful neglect of that Ordinance, but longing for ſome competent meaſure of <hi>preparation,</hi> or opportunity for re-receiving, without a ſtrain to their Conſcience, which are the reaſons why many ſeldom Communicat: In theſe caſes their <hi>ſeldom</hi> receiving will not be found ſo crying a ſin, as many other ſins leſs noticed; profaned Communions whereſoever common and horrid Swearers, God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> dammees, Adulterers, Drunkards, are admitted to be receivers, <hi>the ſin is more crying.</hi>

                  <p>Page 147, <hi>The Lords Supper is ſubſtituted in the place of the Paſſover, which was commanded by the Law, to be celebrated once in the year.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> This occaſioneth no diſpute, for it's plain truth; yet, that the paſſover was but once a year, meriteth conſideration, and ſo much the more, becauſe the Paſchal Lamb Typified Chriſt, who is called our paſſover, and the Lamb of God who taketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the ſin of the World; and tho' I do not obſerve this, thereby to plead that the celebration of the Lords Supper ſhould be no more frequent than the Paſſover; yet it may be conducive for ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the rigide cenſures of ſome againſt others, who cannot celebrat this Sacrament oftner, than once a year, though they willingly would.</p>
                  <p>Page 147. <hi>Since our Saviour hath taken off the confinement as to time and place, it follows, that they who celebrate it ſeldomer than the Jews did their paſſover, muſt needs have leſs regard to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of Chriſts death, and the deliverance wrought by it, than the Jews had to their deliverance out of</hi> Aegypt; <hi>there being no other imaginable reaſon, that can tempt them to neglect purifying of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> This reflection is more ſevere than well proved, for even thoſe who have ſome meaſure of regard to the memory of Chriſts death, may have ſuch impediments invincibly croſſing their deſires, that ſometimes they cannot celebrate ſo often as once a year, which may be the affliction of ſome miniſters, but not their ſinful neglect, nor oblivion of Chriſts death. <hi>but.</hi>

                     <hi>2ly.</hi> It's rare to celebrate it <hi>more ſeldom</hi> than once a year in any congregation of our Communion, where the congregations are brought to any tollerable Settlement. I grant the time was, that the people of our perſwaſion both Miniſters and others, were ſo purſued by Biſhop's Courts, becauſe of their meeting together; and adhering to their ſound principles, that ſome were impriſoned, many Excommunicated, and their Families broken, other hunted

                     <hi>Yet 2ly.</hi> The Author's calling this the opportunity, <hi>whenſoever they meet together,</hi> as <hi>Page</hi> 149. I ſay this cannot generally hold, for Chriſtians may have occaſion to meet together even for wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; when there is no opportunity for celebrating the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, as when God requireth them to meet together for prayer and <hi>faſting,</hi> and the day ſpent in ſuch humbling exerciſes as are then ſuitable. <hi>But.</hi>

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:97381:65"/> this had dropt from a Diſſenters pen, we had heard it again on both ſides of our head.</p>
                  <p>Page 150. <hi>It ſeems then probable from the very inſtitution of this Sacrament, that our Saviour deſigned it ſhould be a part of Gods Service in all the ſolemn Aſſemblies of Chriſtians, as the paſſover was in the yearly Aſſemblies of the</hi> Jews.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> The paralel made by the Author, between the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Aſſemblies and Chriſtian Aſſemblies runeth not even: and to make it ſtraight it muſt run thus; our Saviour deſigned our Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould be a part of Gods Service, in all the ſolemn Aſſemblies of Chriſtians, as the paſſover was in all the Solemn Aſſemblies of the <hi>Jews;</hi> the paralel holdeth not otherwiſe, and then it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth that the paſſover was a part of Gods Service in all the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Aſſemblies of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which could not be, ſince the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſover was but once a year.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>2ly.</hi> If then the paſſover ſervice, as to the time <hi>when,</hi> were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned as a pattern for the time, <hi>when</hi> our Sacrament ſhould be celebrated; then it will follow, that our celebrating ſhould be but once a year; ſo that whatſoever was deſigned by Chriſt, it's evident, our Author's deſign is at a great loſs, by what he now ſayeth.</p>
                  <p>Page 150. <hi>And the ſame is further manifest in the ſecond place, from the examples of the Apoſtles, and of the Churches of God in the</hi> New Teſtament; <hi>they cannot be ſuppoſed but to have underſtood what Chriſt meant by theſe words, Do this in remembrance of me: and if it appears that they did make this feaſt, a constant part of their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary worſhip, we may ſafely conclude that Christ meant it ſhould be ſo alſo: and here it is obſervable, that we do not find any Solemn Stated meeting of Chriſtians for worſhip in the whole</hi> New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>without it. At firſt the diſciples had their meetings every day, and then they likewiſe daily received this Sacrament,</hi> Acts 2 46. <hi>and they continued daily with one accord in the Temple, and in breaking of bread from Houſe to houſe: Their meeting together was on purpoſe and with expreſs deſign to celebrate this Feaſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 20. <hi>When ye come together, therefore into one place, this is not to eat
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:97381:65"/> the Lords Supper, and downward</hi> Page 151: <hi>Then ſurely the Apoſtles ſaying, that when you come together into one place, this is not to eat the Lords Supper,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Gives us ground to conclude that in his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, eating the Lords Supper ought to be one conſtant end of our coming together,</hi> Page 152. <hi>When the meeting of Chriſtians came to be fixed to the firſt day of the week, or the Lords day, the breaking of bread was likewiſe brought to the ſame day, ſo</hi> Acts 20. 7. <hi>And upon the firſt day of the week, when the diſciples came together to break bread,</hi> Paul <hi>preached unto them.</hi>

                     </hi> 20. 7. From which he ſaith, two things may be obſerved: <hi>1ſt.</hi> that the firſt day of the week was the Diſciples time of publick worſhip. <hi>2d.</hi> That the breaking of bread, or Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrating the Holy <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> was a part of that worſhip; the Scripture is as plain for the one as the other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>1ſt.</hi> Now let the Reader obſerve, that the Author having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven up all claime to Scripture <hi>precept,</hi> for the time of celebrating the Lords Supper; he ſearcheth for it in <hi>Examples.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:97381:66"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>2ly.</hi> He bringeth Examples of different times from the Apoſtles practice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>3ly.</hi> He cometh cloſe up to a Divine Inſtitution, for both theſe differing times: becauſe for every days partaking, he ſaith the Apoſtles knew what <hi>Chriſt meant,</hi> and if they made it a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant part of their worſhip, Chriſt ſaith; he meant it ſo alſo.</p>
                  <p>And for the other, <hi>viz.</hi> The firſt day of the week he ſaith: the Scripture is as plain for the Sacrament that day, as for obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the day it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>4ly.</hi> There being here two Apoſtolick practices of equal autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which of them is preceptive or oblidging to us.</p>
                  <p>If the Author ſay the latter of the two, then how will he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer himſelf, ſaying that the Diſciples did meet every day: 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that at every meeting they did celebrate, 3. And being a conſtant part of their ordinary worſhip: we may ſafely conclude, that Chriſt meant it ſhould be ſo, by the Authors arguments</p>
                  <p>Then the <hi>daily celebration,</hi> appeareth to have the greateſt authority of the two: what then ſhall be done next, for fixing of the time? No doubt he had beſt leave it, as Chriſt himſelf did, not confining us to a prefixed time; and it's evident, that we cannot have the times <hi>when,</hi> determined by Apoſtolick practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, becauſe in their own time, the times of celebration were <hi>not one.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It will appear alſo, by a more particular conſideration of the places quoted, <hi>Acts</hi> 2: 46. Is expounded by judicious commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators, to be only the Diſciples ordinary food, expreſſed by brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of bread from Houſe to houſe, and as the remainder of that <hi>Verſe</hi> ſheweth, they did eat their meat with gladneſs, and ſingle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart; The breaking of bread doth not alwayes ſignifie the Lords Supper, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 30. is ordinary food. But the 42. <hi>Verſe</hi> of the <hi>2d.</hi> of the <hi>Acts</hi> is the place where the Sacramental breaking is more clear, <hi>and they continued stedfaſtly in the Apoſtles Doctrine, and fellowſhip,</hi> &amp; <hi>in</hi> breaking of bread, <hi>and in Prayer:</hi> but then it is not <hi>daily,</hi> and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 20. Sayeth no more but that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times yea frequently they did meet for the celebration of the Lords
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:97381:66"/> Supper; but that they did never meet for worſhip on any other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, but to celebrat the Lords Supper is dangerous; for the Goſpel was to be preached fully, Chriſt commanded to teach all things whatſoever he had commanded them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. and <hi>Acts 10. 42. He commanded us to preach to the people</hi> the Doctrine of Salvation; and Chriſts gracious Tranſaction with ſinners, according to the Covenant of Grace, was greater work: and therefore more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted upon by the Apoſtles, than only the Sacramental Seal of the Covenant; Therefore to ſay that their ordinary publick Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies for worſhip was on purpoſe, as the Author ſaith <hi>Page 150, And one main deſign of their coming together</hi> Page 151, cannot be allowed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for what is the Seal without the Doctrine and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, whereunto it is a Seal?</p>
                  <p>Obſerve alſo, that tho' they came together at ſometimes pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely for celebration of the Lords Supper, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11, 20. and <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 7. Yet this will not prove, that all their meetings in Aſſemblies were on this account.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> being by Gods merciful providence preſent with the people; it was very expedient then to celebrate, that they might be inſtructed by him in the right manner of celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, now leaving them.</p>
                  <p>Let the Reader alſo remember that by the Author, the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of the Lords Supper was brought unto, and fixed on the firſt day of the week, <hi>Acts.</hi> 20. 7. And yet ſtill he purſueth their celebrating at every meeting, which was oftner than the firſt day of the week, how he will reconcile and cement both, I leave to himſelf: for it's paſt my reach to reconcil theſe? The Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chriſtians did celebrate at <hi>every meeting</hi> 2. They did meet <hi>every day,</hi> and 3. nevertheleſs it was fixed to the <hi>Lords day,</hi> 4. And our Saviour deſign'd it ſhould be a part of Gods Service, in <hi>all the Solemn Aſſemblies</hi> of Chriſtians; which are on other days than the Lords day.</p>
                  <p>Let it be obſerved alſo, that if they did meet daily for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to celebrate, then why is there any ſuch peculiar remark,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:97381:67"/> on meeting on the Lords day for that purpoſe, if all their meetings had been to celebrate.</p>
                  <p>There is reaſon from that Scripture <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 7. To conclude that there were ordinary Chriſtian Aſſemblies on the firſt day of the week, which were eſtabliſhed by Chriſt himſelf, before <hi>Paul</hi> was a Preacher, for a religious memorial of his Reſurrection, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from all his Sufferings, and on that day they did celebrate the Lords Supper: But I could never ſee a Cogent argument from that Scripture, proving the celebrating <hi>every</hi> Lords day, becauſe, on <hi>that</hi> Lords day they did celebrate, for there were moſt bleſſed Meetings on the Lords day when Chriſt himſelf was with his Diſciples, after his Reſurrection; And yet neither mention nor probability of celebrating his Supper, as <hi>John</hi> 20. 19. On the firſt day of the week Jeſus was with his diſciples, where there was a competent number as at the firſt Inſtitution; yet nothing of this celebration, ſo <hi>Verſe 26. after eight days, again his Diſciples were within, and</hi> Thomas <hi>with them: then came Jeſus, the doors being ſhut, and stood in the midſt:</hi> yet nothing of this celebration; ſo that we have neither preſcription by Chriſt, nor practice to give us example for celebrating every Lords day, which is the more to be remarked, that ſome of theſe times he did meet with them, the Diſciples were at meat, when Chriſt came in among them: as <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 14. And yet nothing of this Sacramental meat; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the celebration was not every Lords day. If any object, that this celebration could not be where Chriſt was viſibly preſent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had ſaid, he would Drink no more of the fruit of the Vine until, <hi>&amp;c. Anſ.</hi> Yet the Diſciples might have celebrated by themſelves, but no mention of it is made. <hi>But,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Page</hi> 150. Our Author ſaith, <hi>that we do not find any Solemn Stated meeting of Chriſtians for worſhip, in the whole</hi> New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>without it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ:</hi> 1. Still the Author purſues Celebrating at every meeting for worſhip under the New Teſtament, But how doth this agree with what the Author ſaith, that by <hi>Act:</hi> 20. 7. The celebrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was fixt to the Lords day? for Chriſtians had meetings for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:97381:67"/> worſhip after that time, and by the Author, at all theſe meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings they did celebrate; now after the celebration was fixed to the Lords Day; How could they celebrat at other times of meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which were not on the Lords Day? for then it followeth, that either fixing it to <hi>every Lords Day</hi> faileth, or elſe that their ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrating at <hi>every meeting</hi> faileth, the reaſon is clear, for if they did celebrat at every meeting, ſome whereof were not on the Lords Day, then the celebration was not fixed to the Lords day; If the Author ſay by fixing it to the Lords Day, they were obliged to celebrat no other day; Then why doth our Author celebrat on <hi>other days</hi> than the Lords Day?</p>
                  <p>In few words I do ſeriouſly demand of the Author, a ſolution to this queſtion, Whether by <hi>Act: 20. verſ:</hi> 7. or any other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or Scriptural example, there be <hi>divine inſtitution</hi> for celebrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lords Supper every Lords Day, yea or not? if he affirm; then the divine inſtitution muſt be by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that we ſhould cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brat every Lords Day; if the times <hi>when</hi> we ſhould celebrat be <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed</hi> by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> then why doth the Author ſay, that our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our hath confined us to no time; if he ſay the <hi>Apoſtles practice</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount not to an <hi>inſtitution</hi> by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> then their practice in this is not a <hi>rule</hi> for us.</p>
                  <p>Its paſt all diſpute, that the Apoſtles and primitive Chriſtians did frequently celebrate the Lords Supper, and by the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Gifts and Graces poured out upon them, great grace being upon them all, they were ordinarly in a readineſs, and prepared for that holy Ordinance, which we in after Generations know little of; and therefore are not in caſe for ſuch <hi>frequency</hi> as they were.</p>
                  <p>And whoever urge frequency of receiving on any terms, ſhould conſider theſe two things, firſt, that the Scripture mentioning <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten:</hi> yet doth not mention <hi>how often.</hi> 2. That upon pain of Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, if we Eat &amp; Drink unworthily. Every Chriſtian ſhould have due time to prepare and examine himſelf, and not to proceed to receiving otherwiſe (command frequency who will) leſt he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane it. And tho I have inſiſted longer on this Debate than I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; yet I will not omit the Authors general challenge.</p>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:97381:68"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That we do not find any ſolemn stated meeting of Christians for wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in the whole New Teſtament without it, that is, without celebrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Lords Supper.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>Anſ:</hi> By this challenge its evident, that its the Authors aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, every ſuch aſſembly had it, and the proof is incumbent to him who alledgeth that at every time of the meetings of ſuch aſſemblies, they did celebrat the Lords Supper; but he will find hard work to prove, that all of them at every time of meeting for Worſhip had it: and let the Reader remark his words, <hi>under the whole New Teſtament.</hi>

                     <hi>Anſ:</hi> If Cathedral Churches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> communicat every Lords Day, this frequency is either by <hi>Chriſts</hi> direction, or without his directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; if by his direction, then why ſhould poor Countrey Souls be deprived of the benefit of receiving every Lords Day, more than the Cathedral Church? <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf is no reſpecter of perſons in ſuch caſes; ſurely the mean and poor in the world have as good a Title to <hi>Chriſts</hi> benefits, as the rich and great: if <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath not directed this frequency, as the Author confeſſeth, he hath confin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us <hi>to no time;</hi> Then whoſe invention is it, that in Cathedrals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     <pb n="128" facs="tcp:97381:69"/> it muſt needs be every Lords Day, though all the Countrey Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes want it?</p>
                  <p>2ly, If Cathedrals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> obtain this priviledge, becauſe many Miniſters are ready to attend the ſervice, then it appears that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience ſhould be conſidered for the celebration, and where all theſe conveniencies offer, the celebration may be more frequent than where they are wanting: But the Author ſaid not long ago, <hi>Page</hi> 148. that there was no other reaſon <hi>imaginable</hi> for non-frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, but the deadneſs of mens hearts; now he findeth other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are imaginable, and why ſhould he not be charitable to ſuch as find not conveniency for ſo frequent receiving as others?</p>
                  <p>For his calling Miniſters under the Goſpel, Prieſts, is unſavory and unwarrantable, ſeing the antient Prieſt-hood is taken down by the coming of Chriſt; and the Sacrifices we have now to offer, are only Spiritual; ſo that Church-Officers under the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are no otherwiſe Prieſts, than all true Believers who are made Kings and Prieſts to God: I think leſs of Papiſts retaining that name, becauſe they profanely make a ſacrifice of <hi>Christ</hi> in the Maſs.</p>

                  <p>Should ſuch perſons be excommunicated, who are ſo far from contempt of that holy Sacrament, that all their fear is, leſt they profane it, by receiving unprepared?

                  </p>
                  <p>The Reader may yet further conſider, that the preparation of the heart in man is <hi>of the Lord,</hi> and therefore <hi>not in mens power</hi> to prepare themſelves when they will; therefore Gods aſſiſtance for preparation muſt be waited for: if the Miniſter urge on peril of excommunication, he muſt and ſhall receive, the man feareth a worſe excommunication, to be caſt out into utter darkneſs, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a wedding garment, and dare not eat and drink damnation to pleaſure his Miniſter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or to avoid temporary excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;

                     <hi>PAge 159. And here firſt I muſt obſerve to you, that you have no fixt or ſet times for the adminiſtration of this Sacrament; on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, your Directory orders that the time how often this is to be celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, may be conſidered and determined by the Miniſters and other Church governours of each Congregation, as they ſhall find moſt convenient for the comfort and edification of the people committed to their charge.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ:</hi> 1. The Author hath ſaid, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath <hi>prefixed</hi> no time.</p>
                  <p>2. He telleth us that the Apoſtles <hi>varyed</hi> the time, ſometimes dayly, and afterwards on the Lords Day. 3. He ſaith they vary the times <hi>themſelves,</hi> for ſome of their Churches have it more ſeldom and ſome more frequently; Why then is it ſo great a crime in us to want fixed times, why did himſelf ſay, <hi>Page</hi> 148. That there can be no better way of determining when, than by obſerving when God giveth <hi>opportunity?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2ly, This opportune ſeaſon for publick edification, we are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to attend; but then <hi>prefixed</hi> times, eſpecially long before ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration, may prove no opportunity, many things may, and often do emerge, making it not convenient for the publick good, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve theſe prefixed times: and that Miniſters, and other Church Governours ſhould determine the time, as the edification of each Congregation requireth, is convenient and neceſſary.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ:</hi> The Author cannot prove that this celebration ought to be a conſtant part of Gods ſervice, the many Scriptures I have already quoted teſtifie the contrary, I perceive the Author preferreth the Popiſh way of conſtant conſecration every Lords Day, to his own way and ours; for he ſaith, <hi>Page 160. And truly in this point you ſeem more unexcuſable than the Papists themſelves; for
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:97381:71"/> the Papiſts order the Elements to be conſecrated every Lords Day, and diſtributed to thoſe that deſire it; but your Teachers neither offer it to the people, nor invite them to it; nay ſo far are they from it, that they do not ſo much as afford an opportunity to thoſe that deſire to be conſtant receivers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And he hath ſaid already, <hi>Page</hi> 159. That they themſelves are too far ſhort of the primitive practice and inſtitution, but the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Prieſts follow it in conſecrating every Lords Day.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ:</hi> As for the Authors preferring the manner of Popiſh Prieſts to our way, is no ſurpriſal to us, ſeing he was pleaſed to yield them ample room in the Communion of the Catholick Church, when he thruſt us out at one blow.</p>
                  <p>2ly, He ſaith <hi>the popiſh Priests diſtribute the Elements</hi> in the plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral number, to thoſe that deſire it. If it be ſo, its a new thing we heard not of, that they diſtribute the Cup to thoſe that deſire it; for they ſay plainly, tho <hi>Chriſt</hi> diſtributed the Cup, yet they ſee it not fit: However we muſt be worſe than Papiſts, do what they will, yea worſe than the moſt <hi>degenerated or barbarous people that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver called themſelves Chriſtians.</hi> This is the Authors ſpirit of meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that he ſaid would give no juſt offence.</p>
                  <p>Page 161. <hi>They rarely preſs their people to communicat.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>Anſ:</hi> We do preſs them to communicat, but much more to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine themſelves that they may be prepared for it.</p>

                  <p>Ibid, <hi>No body can certainly tell, what frequently, many, often or convenient ſignifie: And therefore where only theſe words are uſed in a Rule, it's little better than to have no Rule at all, as appears in this very caſe,</hi>

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Scripture uſeth theſe words <hi>as often,</hi> and is this little betten then <hi>no Rule</hi> at all? This muſt be dangerous treating of the word of God, 2. Theſe ſame words <hi>as often</hi> tho' they be few,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:97381:71"/> yet are much better than no Rule at all, and have been very uſeful to the whole Church of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and encouraged many Souls to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour <hi>frequency</hi> of receiving, becauſe the word of God mentioneth <hi>often,</hi> tho' no not <hi>how often.</hi>

                  <p>Ibid. <hi>I appeal to you, whether it is not yet reckoned a great thing among many of you, if once in a year or two, a Communion be cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated in one of your meetings; nay among ſome of you, it's often ommited for ſeveral years together, and in ſome places for ten, or more.</hi>

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is alſo matter of <hi>Fact</hi> and a great miſtake, for we account it no great thing to have it every year, and ſome of us have it oftner, and ſome of our Communion have it much oftner than once or twice a year, as God giveth them opportunity; and all of us would be glad of conveniency for having it more frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: But let the Reader underſtand, that we judge it not warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, to admit perſons to the Lords Table, becauſe they have in their memory, and can ſay over <hi>the belief, the Lords prayer, and Ten Commandments,</hi> which a Child, or an Athieſt may have in readineſs to repeat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But Stewards of the Myſteries of God, who muſt not caſt Pearls before Swine, tho' they judge not of mens hearts, leaving that to God, whoſe Prerogative it is; yet muſt have ſome ſatisfying account, of a competent meaſure of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in partakers, and muſt take care to know they are able, to diſcern the Lords Body, as likewiſe, that they have ſome know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Covenant of Grace, the Sacrament being a Seal thereof, and beſides their knowledge, which this is but a taſte of, leſt Miniſters be partakers of other mens ſins, by profaning the Holy Sacrament, they muſt alſo take care, that ſuch be not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, whoſe practice doth contradict their profeſſion of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity.</p>
                  <p>As alſo, ſometimes Miniſters muſt take time, to ſupport the weak, dejected by their own fears and doubts, and to encourage them as occaſion ſerveth, to approach the Lords Table; ſo, alſo to have any Animoſities, or contentions compoſed and healed, that may be found amongſt the people before they receive. And

                  <p>We have alſo by the tender mercies of our God, Goſpel Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances Adminiſtred in our publick Aſſemblies, according to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Primitive ſimplicity, not willingly omitting, adding, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praving, any part thereof: nor hath the Author by all his elaborate diſcourſe, inſtructed any Deviation from Scripture inſtitution, in our publick Adminiſtrations, tho' no doubt we are guilty, as to the manner and ſpiritual performances.</p>
                  <p>Having then a Miniſtry and Goſpel Ordinances according to Chriſts inſtitution, and our Miniſters gifted by him, with ſome meaſure of competent Qualifications for all Miniſterial work, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in their work, and of Godly converſation; we judge our ſelves
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:97381:75"/> ſafeſt as to our Conſciences, where we are; and tho our deſires were never ſo ardent for Peace and Unity in the Church, yet what is now ſaid, and much more to this purpoſe ſaid by others, together with theſe two Scriptures, <hi>Matth. 20. verſes</hi> 25, 26, 27. and <hi>Luke 22. verſes</hi> 24, 25, 26, and 27. Notwithſtanding of all the Gloſſes put on them, by men affecting preheminency; yet to us they are ſo plain and awful, that we dare not, we cannot, and by Gods grace will not countenance any thing that is there for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Since the Author doth ſo particularly deſire, that our people be not indulged in ſuch affected diſtances; good manners requireth that either the demand be granted, or ſome reaſon why it cannot; as for affecting diſtances we diſown it, wiſhing that God would open their eyes who <hi>make the diſtance;</hi> for we look upon our ſelves as ridiculed, Firſt to barricado our way, and then invite us to come in.</p>
                  <p>And if the Author be pleaſed to conſider, I will ſerve him with ſome neceſſary informations concerning his Book. That he hath miſſed the <hi>Art</hi> of making Proſelytes, for many upon peruſal of the Book, are determined to a greater averſation, and diſtance than ever before; and no wonder, conſidering</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> That they can expect no <hi>Goſpel preaching</hi> in communion with the Author, affirming, that all <hi>preaching</hi> is either reading of the Scriptures, or publiſhing of the Goſpel to ſuch as never heard it before: our people heard the Goſpel long ago; and therefore can expect nothing but <hi>reading;</hi> ſo that they muſt adhere to that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, where they know to find Goſpel Preaching; the great mean of Salvation: for Faith cometh by hearing, and how can they hear <hi>without a preacher?</hi> Could this be a Load-ſtone to draw men by telling they need expect no preaching?</p>
                  <p>2ly, We are told in hyperbolicks for much reading, that the Scriptures <hi>apply themſelves:</hi> but many find it otherwiſe, requiring adventious help; our Saviour and his Apoſtles explained and apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Scriptures: and our people find it neceſſary for their Souls, being ſenſible that they are ready to erre, not knowing the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:97381:76"/> yea to wreſt them to their own deſtruction, as others have done before them.</p>
                  <p>3ly, They find by the Book, ground to fear dangerous Doctrine concerning <hi>Prayer,</hi> obſerving how frequently <hi>conceived prayers</hi> are expoſed as <hi>meer invention,</hi> which they know to be allowed by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> practiſed by his Apoſtles; and generally all the godly whoſe pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are recorded in Scripture, and themſelves by experience find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the gracious promiſed help of the ſpirit of Grace and Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, aſſiſting them in Prayer, ſoftning their hearts, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them into Communion with God, without the words of any Form.</p>
                  <p>4ly, By the Book they are diſcouraged to <hi>read the Scriptures in privat,</hi> ſeing its alledged there's <hi>no promiſe to ſuch reading,</hi> they know not but they might <hi>hear</hi> as they <hi>read;</hi> and have no mind to be tempted to negligence in reading the Scriptures, knowing that God hath both promiſed a bleſſing to ſuch reading of his Word, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually bleſſed their<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> own Souls in performing that Duty; yea the greateſt Lights of all the antient Fathers have left it on record, that privat reading the Scriptures was the very mean God bleſſed for their converſion to Chriſtianity.</p>
                  <p>5ly, That aſſertion, <hi>that ſuch as cannot fit themſelves for receiving at the Lords Table thrice a year, must needs think themſelves out of a state of Grace, and ſo deſerve to be excommunicated,</hi> Is ſuch a Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Bolt as hath frighted many into a greater diſtance than ever: leſt themſelves ſhould be ſo ſerved, and that only for their <hi>weakneſs,</hi> becauſe they cannot fit themſelves; many are ready to look upon it as having too direct a tendency to deſperation, if poor Souls ſhould be caſt out of the Church, for their <hi>weakneſs;</hi> for ſome well meaning people might be tempted to think, they were caſt out of Gods favour, becauſe caſt out of the Church.</p>
                  <p>6ly, Many Readers find in the Book, <hi>Scriptures quoted</hi> for that which they do <hi>not prove,</hi> and ſometime that called the Command of God, which he never commanded, this alſo frighteth from hearing leſt they <hi>hear</hi> as they <hi>read.</hi>

                  <p>7ly, We are told that the mode of entring Churches, is with ſome bodily Worſhip; but this being religious Worſhip, we muſt know what is its Object: for the ſecond Command diſchargeth our worſhipping of God by Images, or the likeneſs of any thing: but this worſhip as hath been proved in its due place, is firſt dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to the Fabrick of an Houſe.</p>
                  <p>8ly, We are told by the Book, that we muſt kneel in the act of receiving Bread and Wine at the Lords Supper; but the ſecond Command ſtandeth in our way here alſo, diſcharging religious Worſhip deſignedly before any Creatures, this alſo I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in its proper place, I ſhall forbear, though I might add moe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, whereby its evident we are <hi>bolted out</hi> from that joyning in Worſhip and Sacraments, which is required of us.</p>
                  <p>There is no more in this Epiſtle, but what is particularly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered already in the proper places: but</p>

                  <p>Let the Reader obſerve, and remember that Scriptural Paſtors appointed to feed their flocks, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 28. are alſo required to overſee them, this feeding and overſeeing, is the higheſt Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial power over the flock, that any Officer in the Houſe of God can claim by right, and whoever paſtorally feedeth, by tenor of the ſame commiſſion is to overſee, which feeding and overſeeing is to guide, govern, and rule by the Laws of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and therefore e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Paſtor hath this power by his Commiſſion, without being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden to any other, who has no other commiſſion from <hi>Chriſt</hi> than themſelves: beſides that Miniſterial ruling is plainly ly declared to be the Right of Presbyters, and therefore cannot without Sacriledge be appropriated, or reſerved by one, to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of others 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17.</p>
                  <p>Next, <hi>The Laity,</hi> (as the Author termeth them) <hi>are deſired to conſider and lay to heart what he tendereth to them, for he cannot prevail with them to come and receive inſtruction from his mouth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ:</hi> No doubt they <hi>do conſider</hi> what is ſaid, but ſome of them ſay, the more they conſider, <hi>the leſs they lay to heart;</hi> and to ſay truth, if readers take pains to conſider well what they read, there's no danger of becoming Proſelytes.</p>
                  <p>2ly, <hi>It's complained that the people will not come to hear inſtruction from the Authors mouth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ:</hi> Is there none to give inſtruction in the Dioceſs, if they come not to receive it from the Authors mouth? are there not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Teachers of his own communion in the Dioceſs? but this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth what is aboveſaid, that he is the one appointed.</p>
                  <p>2ly, Can all the Diſſenters of the Dioceſs of <hi>Derry</hi> come to hear and be inſtructed by <hi>his own mouth?</hi> the whole <hi>body of the people</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diſſenters, where could be the hearing place? where the voice to reach ſo many thouſands?</p>
                  <p>3ly, Since this is the Authors regret, that all the people come not to hear him, his beſt relief is to take charge of no more than can hear him, and then he is not only eaſed of his complaint and grief;
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:97381:78"/> but beſides, ſhall be more conform'd to Scripture Rules; feeding a flock <hi>perſonally</hi> wherever he is made <hi>Overſeer,</hi> for any man to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in a <hi>Charge</hi> which he ſhall never be able to <hi>diſcharge</hi> is in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable, and his <hi>delegation</hi> to others under him, that which he calleth his own charge and work, hath <hi>no colour of warrand</hi> from any Scripture, or Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>Page 182. <hi>In this Treatiſe I have not led you into long Reaſonings, or the intricacies of humane Learning, but I have referred you to your Bibles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ:</hi> It was no doubt diſcretion to take care the Laity ſhould not be confounded with too ſublime ſpeculations; yet the Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick Patterns are too ſublime for either Clergy or Laity.</p>
                  <p>2ly, Our people are referred to their Bibles, the Author could not adviſe them better, eſpecially when they are well Expounded; and the advice is to be the more regarded, ſince the Authors own people, are recommend <hi>but</hi> to the Book of Common Prayer, as their beſt Family Devotion.</p>
                  <p>Ibid: <hi>I would deſire you to obſerve, that it ever has been, and in all probability ever will be the humour of the World, to be more fond of their own inventions, than of what God commands.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ:</hi> The Author ſaith well, for Inventions being mens own Brats, are dear to their Parents, were they never ſo deformed.</p>
                  <p>2ly, He ſaith, in probabillty, this will be ever <hi>the humour of the World;</hi> if it be ſtill the humour of the World, Why but it may be the <hi>Authors humour</hi> alſo? for he is yet in the World, as others.</p>
                  <p>And if he ſay of himſelf and his, though they be <hi>in</hi> the World, yet they are not <hi>of</hi> the World, and that only a rable of reprobat Diſſenters are <hi>the men of this World;</hi> if this be the Authors ſenſe of us, he is but conſiſtent with himſelf in what he elſewhere pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, that ſuch as we are <hi>belong not to the Catholick Church,</hi> and ſo are the men of this world in the worſt ſenſe, <hi>being without Christ, having no hope, and without God in the world;</hi> I could never learn of any other, <hi>but a Pope</hi> that hath <hi>excommunicated</hi> ſo many famous Churches, <hi>ſound in the Faith:</hi> Neither is this ignominy done to the Churches of God, ever yet publickly retracted, as it ought to be,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:97381:79"/> though detected, publiſhed, and ſolidly Confuted by <hi>Mr. Boyſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thoſe whom the Author now writeth to, have found it to their ſmart, who are moſt fond of Inventions, they cannot be bewildred where to find them, many of them being excommunicated, fin'd, and confined, for no other cauſe, but non-complyance with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable inventions in the worſhip of God.</p>
                  <p>Page 183, and 184. The Author accuſeth the Laity for bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in extemporary prayers, ſaying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>It's plain you have brought them into practice, againſt the opinion of the Church governours; and of the firſt Reformers, who all did ſettle Liturgies in the Churches which they Reformed; this</hi> Knox <hi>did in</hi> Scotland, Luther <hi>for</hi> Germany, Calvin <hi>for</hi> Geneva <hi>and the</hi> French <hi>Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ:</hi> Was it the Laity taught their Teachers to pray <hi>conceived prayers?</hi> No ſure, for the Spirit of God teacheth all the <hi>Children of God ſuch prayers,</hi> when the Author pleaſeth, let him anſwer the Scripture proofs I have brought for it; we find <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs, <hi>Job, Moſes,</hi> the Prophets, our Saviour himſelf, and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, all uſing conceived prayers without a form; ſo that the beſt Church Guides has taught the people ſuch prayers, and not the people them.</p>
                  <p>2ly, Our firſt Reformers from Popery allowed ſome forms, and did well in ſo doing, when few qualified perſons, either for preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or praying could be found, ſo <hi>Homilies</hi> were appointed in place of <hi>preaching,</hi> becauſe the poor ignorant Prieſts could neither preach nor pray.</p>
                  <p>3ly, Our firſt Reformers did then pray <hi>conceived prayers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> and limited no Miniſters by forms of humane compoſure, whom God gifted for extemporary prayers, and all theſe Churches to this day, <hi>uſe conceived prayers</hi> in their publick Aſſemblies.</p>
                  <p>Page 184. <hi>And let me tell you that it is no hard matter to give a reaſon, why the generality of people are better pleaſed with ſuch extempora<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry prayers, than with forms; for can any wonder that a prayer which peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple never heard before, and is adapted to the fancies and humours of a party, with all the advantages which novelty gives, ſhould gratifie car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and itching ears, more than the fixed and ſetled prayers of a Church!
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:97381:79"/> whereas there is a pleaſure and a kind of ſenſual delight in the novelty of the other prayers, and the Tone wherewith they are ſometimes deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, makes the hearers imaginarily devout.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ:</hi> Here is judging, and cenſuring to the higheſt degree, and that very judging which is forbidden of God, for men to judge of mens hearts, which is Gods prerogative: For firſt, he ſaith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary prayers are <hi>adapted to the fancies</hi> and humours of people, that is when Miniſters pray conceived prayers, they <hi>fit theſe prayers for fancies,</hi> as if they prayed to God, that peoples fancies might be humoured, which were an atheiſtical profanation of prayer; by what authority doth the Author judge the ſecret deſigns of the hearts of Miniſters?</p>
                  <p>2ly, Have all thoſe who hear and joyn with conceived prayers, <hi>nothing but fancies</hi> and humors for their Religion; and love concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved prayers, becauſe thereby their fancies are pleaſed? then all who heard and joyned with the Apoſtles prayers, which they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard before, and obtained many bleſſings by theſe prayers, they were all deluded, for only their <hi>fancies were pleaſed,</hi> this is the very ſtuff we have from the worſt of men in this age, decrying all the operations of the Spirit of Grace, as meer fancy; Doth all Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters in the Church of <hi>England?</hi> who uſe extemporary prayer, adapt them all to fancies and humours? are all the prayers of the Reformed Churches adapted to fancies? if our Author know of no better conceived prayers, we need not admire that he is ſuch an admirer of Forms; or is it only we in the North of <hi>Ireland,</hi> or in this Dioceſs, who adapt our prayers to fancies? Can the Author think of anſwering to God for ſuch uncharitable judging? We are thankful to God who aſſiſteth us to pray againſt peoples fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and humours, but never for them: Is this the ſpirit of meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? Is this the way <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>3ly, Hath the Author this by Revelation, that peoples <hi>delight</hi> in prayer is <hi>ſenſual</hi> and no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>ſpiritual?</hi> if he have it not <hi>by revelation,</hi> how cometh he to know the internal delight of mens ſouls? whoever hath run higher on Gods Prerogative, of judging the ſecrets of mens hearts?</p>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:97381:80"/>
                  <p>If the Author will ſuffer faithful plain dealing, I would tender my humble Advice, that he would judge more ſparingly, leſt if ſuch perſons obtain real ſpiritual and Holy delight in prayer, (as in charity I hope ſome of them do) he be found tampering with a moſt dangerous Tool, that may give a wound to his Conſcience hereafter, not eaſily healed; had the Author judged only of mens External Actions, I ſhould have ſaid little: but to judge of mens ſecret deſigns and delights, is inaccountable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>4ly.</hi> We are told the tone wherewith conceived prayers are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, makes the hearers imaginarily devote.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> It's probable the Author may underſtand this better than we do, for we are no ſuch Admirers of <hi>tones in prayer</hi> as I hear <hi>ſome are,</hi> having never either ejected, nor rejected a Miniſter for want of this great gift of toning of Prayers, but think it ſafeſt that every man uſe that natural way of ſpeaking which God his Maker hath allowed him; and to urge no man apiſhly to <hi>counterfit</hi> other mens voices, which is never found to frame well with any man, and juſt with God it ſhould be ſo; when men are either <hi>ſo ſimple</hi> as to be forced from their natural way of ſpeaking, or ſo <hi>Hypocritical</hi> as for applauſes to be <hi>other mens Apes:</hi> My humble opinion is, that all Miniſters ſhould be ſure in their own Conſciences they are free of vain affectation of <hi>tones, or vain words</hi> in their publick Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations: Next that ſuch as hear and joyn in worſhip, be not ſo much concerned with the manner of mens ſpeaking, as with the matter that is ſpoken, and therefore cannot give my <hi>Amen</hi> to our Author's aſſertion elſe-where, <hi>Page 165. The distinct affectionat manner of pronouncing and reading, &amp;c.</hi> is <hi>abſolutely neceſſary to give life and efficacy to it</hi> for the ſpirit of Chriſt is only abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſar to give life and efficacy: <hi>Paul's</hi> ſpeech was complained of as contemptible, yet life and efficacy by the bleſſing of God at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended his ſpeech.</p>
                  <p>Page 186. <hi>It's manifeſt that extemporary prayers would be much more eaſie to moſt of us, and leſs burthenſome than the ſervice we uſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> If this be received it muſt be on the Author's teſtimony,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:97381:80"/> for otherwiſe it's improbable: but if he would try conceived prayers a year or two in publick, and then give his opinion that they are eaſieſt, his teſtimony then might go a great way.</p>
                  <p>I know no way ſuch prayers can be eaſieſt, but when men have ſuch aſſiſtance of the Spirit of prayer as rendereth them comfortable, and therefore eaſie to him that prayeth; and if the Author have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of this, it's pity he ſhould ever pray by a book, for read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the time of praying, muſt needs be a great diverſion to a Soul immediatly directing deſires unto God, reading being a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Act of it ſelf, having nothing of the nature of prayer in it, nor any way to promote it, but rather at leaſt an <hi>avocation</hi> from the work of prayer, for prayer of it ſelf is ſufficient work for the beſt of men, tho' they be no hindred by another unſeaſonable work of reading, and keeping mens eyes on a book, which ſhould rather be lifted up to Heaven after our Saviours example.</p>

                  <p>The Lord having not only in mercy eſtabliſhed your judgments, but given you good hope through grace, then you are to hold faſt what ye have received, and be as a fountain ſealed, not loſing what ye have wrought, or God hath wrought for you: but improving it for the glory of the giver, and your own ſtability: not hearkning to ſuggeſtions and temptations that have a tendency to raze the foundation already well laid, as if it were to lay again; whereby ſome are rendered miſerable in their religion, being as a City with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out walls, and their hearts as the high way, that any deſtroyer hath acceſs to: we are to leave the principles of the doctrine of Chriſt fix'd and unmoveable, not to return on them as ſtill diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable by every new temptation, but to bolt all ſuch temptations out of doors on the firſt view, as ſent to obſtruct our progreſs and going on to perfection, as we are commanded.</p>

You have God to walk before as ſtill under his Eye, and willing he ſee all you do, content he ſearch you, though you know the Heavens are not clean in his ſight, and far leſs polluted clay; yet ſatisfied he know your heart toward him, that he hath made you hate what he hateth, and love to do theſe thing that are pleaſing in his ſight, you are Commanded alſo to walk with him, as near unto him, yea to walk in him, and ſo to be Supplied for wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king before him, and with him: O the happineſs and dignity to be found in this walk! if a Prince would permite you to walk with him but half an hour, how would you be ſurpriſed with Joy! what hope would it raiſe of future Favour? how ready would you be to Publiſh it? but this walk (wherein I cannot ſo much as mention a Compariſon) ye may have for ordinary, which cannot but be the Wonder of all who attain it. Will God in very deed dwell with men on the Earth? But few admire it becauſe few attain it.</p>
                  <p>By your Practice and Holy Converſation, you muſt Glorifie him before men, let your light ſhine, that others ſeeing your good works, may Glorifie your Father which is in Heaven: and yet take care you do not your works to be ſeen of men for vain glory to your ſelves: Happy is the man who formeth his Converſation for Convincing and Edifying of others, and yet willing himſelf never to be ſeen or notticed, this is the man formed for God to ſhew forth his Praiſe, yea, bleſſed is the man who doth or ever did any thing inteerly for Gods glory; it is worth the labours of our whole lifetime to have the Comfort of it, when we muſt go the way of all the Earth: and miſerable is the man, who breathing out his Soul into another World amongſt other Imbodied Souls, hath this to go with, here is a Soul that never did good but hurt to other Souls, helped none to Heaven, but many to Hell: Let theſe few things be your care in all commpany to do no hurt, to receive no hurt, to do good, and receive what good ye can learn of others</p>

See that ſecret Prayer be not neglected by any, older or younger who are capable in the Family; the neglect whereof, of it ſelf will prove a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be ungodly, for every Godly one will pray, and every Child of God hath an inclination, and ſome meaſure of help to Pray, by the Promiſed ſpirit of Grace and Supplications; if you have not a Diſpoſition to Pray, you have not the Spirit of Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption. Remember the Sabbath be kept Holy in your Families, waſte not that Holy time in idleneſs, come and bring all you can with you, to Worſhip God in the publick Aſſemblie: Find not your own pleaſures, nor ſpeak your own words on the Lords day; it is a great Diſcovery of a Conſcientious Chriſtian, who though tempted by others, yet dars not profane the Sabbath by worldly Diſcourſe, weary not of Sabbaths, but account them a delight, and a merciful gift of God for the good of our Souls: it hath been the Comfort of growing Chriſtians to think on the Sabbaths drawing near, knowing they might then warrnatably lay aſide all Earthly cares and thoughts, and ſo inteerly Converſe with their God: ſome of you have your daily bread to labour for through the week, whereby ye are ſometimes ſcanted for time to your Souls, therefore loſs none of your Holy time; but when you are not at publick worſhip, be often at Prayer, though the Sabbath muſt not be your only praying day, read much Scripture, and what profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Books ye can purchaſe, not books of Controverſie, being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitable

It is profitable alſo every Lords day after puklick worſhip to Meditate what hath been the Voice of God to us that day in particular, that there may be ſuitable returns in our Practice. I ſhall add only one word to you who are Maſters of Families; that you make Conſcience of calling your Children, and Servants to an Account of what they Hear in publick, and of their proficiency in knowledge, of the Principles of Chriſtianity.</p>
                  <p>I muſt now Contract what I would ſay further; though your true Comfort and Peace be much deſired: that you may Rejoyce and work Righteouſneſs, finding all the Paths of Wiſdom, Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs and Peace: the Joy of the Lord is your ſtrength, and the peace of God ſhall keep your hearts and minds: when men are loading you with Reproaches, God will plead the Cauſe of your Reproach, and give Joy that no Stranger ſhall intermeddle with. And that ye may be enabled, not only to Suffer, but to take pleaſure in Reproaches for Chriſts ſake, poſſeſſing your Souls in Patience, and Rejoycing in hope of the glory of God.</p>

                  <p>If God in his mercie give you the earneſt of this Inheritance, then grieve not the Holy Spirit, whereby ye are Sealed unto the day of Redemption.
